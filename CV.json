An \nactigraph is a watch -like device attached to the wrist t hat uses an accelerometer to \nmeasure movement nearly continuously over several days. An American Academy of \n 4\n Sleep Medicine 2002 report defines the practice parameters for the use of actigraphy as a \nuseful tool for detecting sleep in healthy individuals, as sessing specific aspects in \ninsomnia and restless leg syndrome, and a useful adjunct to a detailed history and \nsubjective sleep diary for diagnosing and treating insomnia, circadian -rhythm disorders, \nand excessive sleepiness. Concurrent with these recommen dations is an increased interest \nin the use of actigraphy as a tool for objectively measuring fatigue. With improved high -\nend statistical methods for analyzing this data, actigraphy has the potential to become \nmore important as an objective diagnostic tool  for determining fatigue, sleep \nabnormalities and assessing response to treatment. Other special areas of neurology and \nmedicine where actigraphy can be used more effectively include restless leg syndrome, \nthe elderly and nursing home patients with and wit hout dementia, newborns, infants, \nchildren, and adolescents, hypertensive individuals, depressed or schizophrenic patients, \nand individuals in in accessible situations.   \nRole:  Co-Investigator  \n \n Current  \nR01 AG034119 -01A1    PI: Xiong, Chengjie   8/01/2010 -7/31/2015  \nNIH/NIA  \nTwo Preclinical Latent Scores to Predict Occurrence of DAT  \nThis project will determine the earliest preclinical cognitive changes prior to the \nsymptomatic onset of  AD, and associate such changes with a wide spectrum of \nbiomarkers (CSF, PIB, MRI).  \nRole: Co -Investigator  \n \n Pending  \n \nNSF- SES- Methodolog y, Measurement, and Statistics  \nFunctional Trend and Variability in Clustered Longitudinal Studies.  \nRole: PI  \n \nAlzheimer's Association – New Investigator Research Grant  \nEarly Detection of Alzhei mer's Disease with Multimodal Markers . \nRole: PI  \n \nCollaboration and Consulting:  \n \n Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics, Washington University in St.Louis, \nSchool of Medicine, 2012  \n-- A program sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and \nthe National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), in which I am one of the \ninstructors . \n Statistical Consultant for the law firm of “Rosenblum, Goldenhesh, Silverstein & Zafft”,       \nClayton, MO, 63105, 2012  \n-- I provide statistical analyses for some of their lawsuits.  \n Clayton School District Mathematical Program Review, 2012  \n 5\n -- A consulting project for the Clayton school district (MO), in which I am in charge of \nstatistical analysis fo r their math program review.   \n \n USRDS (United States Renal Data System) Erythropoietin Index project & Myocardial \nInfarction project, 2004 -2006  \n--A collaboration with medical researchers, in which I am responsible for data analysis \nof a large observationa l study (more than 10 GB of data), developing SAS MACROs, \nfitting survival and varying -coefficient statistical models and writing statistical reports.  \n Entomology butterfly project, 2005  \n Consultant for STAT LAB, Summer 2003  \n \nTeaching Experience:   \n  \n Students:  \nLan Xu (Master, May, 2013 ) \nAdam Cheng (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, Dec., 2012)  \nDan Kowal (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, May, 2012)  \nArtem Kreimer (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, May, 2012)  \n \n Washington University  \n \nSemiparametric Statistics (Math 533)  \nTheories in Statistics (Math 5061, 5062)  \nAdvanced Linear Models (Math 4392)  \nProbability (Math 493)  \nMathematical Statistics (Math 494)  \nStatistical Computation (Math 475)  \nSurvival Analysis (Math 434)  \nMatrix Algebra (Math 309)  \n \n UC Davis (As an Instructor)  \n \nProbability Modeling (STA 102), Introduction to Statistics (STA 13)  \n \n As a Teaching Assistant:  \n \nLongitudinal Data Analysis (G) ,Introduction to Probability Theory (U), Time Series \nAnalysis (U), Analysis of Variance (U), Probability Modeling (U), Elementary \nStatistics (U), Probability & Statistics in Engineering (U)  \n \nDepartment Committees:  \n Statistics committee chair: 2012 -2013  \n Statistics committee, 2006 -2013  \n Undergraduate committee, 2011 -2012  \n Special lecture committee, 2009 -2010  \n Departmental colloquium commit tee chair, 2008 -2009  \n Statistical seminar organizer, 2007 -2009  \n Graduate screening committee, 2006 -2008  \n 6\n  Graduate student independence studies, 2006 -2008  \n \n \nAcademic Service:  \n \n Editorial Work: referee for  \no Annals of Statistics  \no Journal of American Statistical Association  \no Annals of Applied Statistics  \no Biometrics,  \no Statistica Sinica,  \no Life Time Data,  \no Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,  \no Books published by Springer.  \no Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,  \no Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,  \n \n Conference Session Chair: Institute of Mathematical Statistics Asia Pacific Rim \nMeeting, Tsukuba, Japan, July 2012.  \n Conference Session Chair and Organizer: Joint Statistical Meetings, San Diego, CA, \nAug. 2012.  \n Conference Session Chair, First Joint Biostati stics Symposium, Beijing, July, 2010.  \n Conference Session Chair: 2009 ICSA Applied Statistical Symposium, San Francisco, \nCA, June, 2009.  \n Conference Organization: I assisted in organizing the Focused Research Group \nConference  in Aug. 2005.

Iowa State Corn  yield forecast model  with PCA dimension reduction and Random Forest  algorithm.   \n    Use the historical Precipitation, Temperature and Sea Surface Temperature  (SST)  data to predict the annual corn \nyield of 9 Iowa Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs) through 1950 to 2015. The data is with very high dimensionalities \nand lar ge volumes  (96 locations in 714 month data for Precipitation and Temperature data; 2683 locations in 714 \nmonths for the SST data) . The PCA technique  is applied to reduce the data dimension ality.  \n    To evaluate the objective performance of the predictive model, a novel 10 -year running sampling framework is \nestablished. For the prediction of each year, only the previous 10 years data is applied in the training data set. The \nperformances of models are evaluated through all past 50 years. After deliberate com parison and analysis of various \nstatistical methods, the Random Forest model achieved best result. Except for a few years with extreme weather like \n1988 and 1993, the model exhibits very nice accuracy and strong reliability.  \n2. Rossmann Pharmacy Sales pred ictions  with time series analy sis and Random Forest algorithm.  \n    To predict the sales of Rossmann (one of the largest pharmacy store chain in Europe), the very large and complex \ndata (including promotions, competition, school and state holidays seasonali ty and locality informat ion of 1115 \nstores) are provided. After the data exploration and cleaning, a Random Forest model is established and achieved \nvery high accuracy (Cross Validation MSE ~ 0.01 of sales amount under log scale). The factor importance ana lysis \nand outlier analysis furthermore suggested the extreme weather condition is the most potential influential factor.  \n3. Prudential Life Insurance Assessment Analysis  with Ridge Regression method . \n    Prudential is one of the largest issuers of life ins urance in the USA. The model is built based on over a hundred \nvariables describing attributes of life insurance applicants, from demographic, health condition, Medical record to \ninsurance history, etc. To deal the high dimensional model, the Ridge Regressi on model is applied for the model \nselection. The model provides very nice accuracy.   \n4. SpringLeaf Market Response predictions  with feature selections algorithm . \n    Using a large set of anonymous features of customer information to build the predictive model on the customer \nresponse. To deal with the data with very high dimensions (1932 features with 145232 customers), different model \nselection and dimension reduc tion techniques are applied.  ",

Personal Statement I am an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine, starting from September 2024. I am highly motivated to pursue an academic career in vision science, especially in eye development and diseases. My PhD training in molecular biology and cell biology, together with my postdoctoral training in ophthalmology and mouse genetics, has equipped me with the skills to successfully conduct research in this field. I obtained my PhD degree in Physiology with Dr. Xing-Zhen Chen at University of Alberta. I studied the interactions of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network, using in vitro cell culture models. I identified novel binding partners of membrane proteins, including Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel TRPP2 and Epithelium Sodium Channel (ENaC), and further demonstrated the regulatory roles of cytoskeleton on channel function. This research provided me with extensive experience in strategies used in molecular biology and cell biology, which will be valuable for conducting mechanistic studies in my further research. When I joined Dr. Xin Zhang’s lab at Columbia University as a postdoctoral researcher, I began to study how Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling regulates lens and lacrimal gland development. I received comprehensive training in mouse genetics and various aspects of eye development and diseases. My published work has provided insights into how FGF signalling is propagated1 and its role in lens development2, and has also elucidated the unique functions of FGF downstream cascades including mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)4, and phospholipase Cg (PLCg)5 pathways, in lacrimal gland development.  With a solid background in studying signaling networks using mouse genetics, my long-term research goal is to explore the role of lipid signaling networks in eye development. As an initial step toward this goal, I propose to establish a mouse model to investigate the role of the lipid phosphatase OCRL, whose deficiency causes a genetic disorder with ocular manifestations in humans. Ongoing and recently completed projects that I would like to highlight include:  K99EY032171-01A Role: PI 06/2022-08/2028 Signaling networks and transcriptional programs in lens vesicle formation   \n Citations: 1.

Contribution to Science PhD career \n1. Discovery of the dynamics of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network. My PhD study was mainly focused on studying the structural and functional interactions of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network. 1) I have identified a cytoskeletal protein filamin-A as a novel binding partner of polycystin-2, the mutations of which account for ~15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). I further discovered a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism of the polycystin-2 and filamin-A complex. These publications have contributed to the ADPKD field by suggesting a dynamic working model of polycystin-2 and the cytoskeletons. 2) I also systematically characterized the structural and functional interaction between the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and filamin. This work suggests a link between ENaC and ADPKD through the cytoskeleton.  a. Wang Q, Dai XQ, Li Q, Wang Z, Cantero Mdel R, Li S, Shen J, Tu JC, Cantiello H, Chen XZ.

PubMed Central PMCID: PMC4393133.  2. Identification of Cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of the polycystic proteins. In collaboration with colleagues, we systematically studied the role of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of PKD2, which encodes polycystin-2, and found that both UTRs contain critical motifs that control polycystin-2 translation. This work elucidated the mechanisms underlying translational regulation of polycystin-2. We also identified polycystin-2L1 (also called TRPP3) as a novel regulatory target of the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1). The property of TRPP3 channel in response to calcium and acid was further characterized in the Xenopus oocyte model. This work elucidates the mechanisms of functional regulation of TRPP3 channel. a.

PubMed PMID: 23985800.  Post-doctoral career 3. Dissecting the role of FGF downstream cascades in lacrimal gland development. My postdoctoral research is focused on how FGF downstream cascades regulate lacrimal gland development. 1) I showed that FGF induced PI3K signaling restricts EGF receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region and demonstrated that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for the induction of lacrimal gland buds. 2) I found that Phospholipase Cγ regulates lacrimal gland branching by competing with PI3K in phosphoinositide metabolism. This work has been awarded the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) postdoctoral fellowship in 2018-2020. 3) In collaboration with colleagues, we demonstrated the role of Etv (also called Pea3) transcription factors in lacrimal gland cell fate determination. We found that loss of Pea3 family genes biased the lacrimal gland epithelium toward an epidermal cell fate. This study resolves the long-standing conundrum of how FGF induces the lacrimal gland fate, providing directives for lacrimal gland regeneration for future treatment of dry eye diseases.  \na.

In collaboration with colleagues, 1) we investigated how FGF signaling is propagated through its adaptor protein complex. We found that Shc1 collaborates with Frs2 and Shp2 to target Grb2 in FGF signaling in lens development (accepted in Elife). 2) we studied the role of FGF downstream transcription factors Etv family members. We elucidated a functional divergence between FGF signaling and its downstream signal regulated transcription factors Etv genes in lens development.  a.

Discovery of the signaling networks in lens vesicle formation. 1) In collaboration with colleagues, we found that Abelson kinase regulates FGF signaling to promote the tension-mediated lens vesicle separation (under revision in Science Advances). 2) I identified mTOR signaling as a novel regulator in lens vesicle separation process, and I am currently investigating the mechanisms of mTOR-mediated lens vesicle separation (K99/R00 proposal). This research will uncover the mTOR signaling networks during lens vesicle development, which is novel and significant in the field of lens development. a.

Over the past five years, \nmy laboratory has established a strong track record of studying rotavirus -host interactions, SARS -\nCoV-2 intestinal infection, and antiviral immunity at mucosal surfaces. My strategic vision for the next \nfive years involves leveraging the rotavirus reverse genetics system, primary intestinal organoid \ncultures, and a neonatal mouse model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying rotavirus \nhost range restriction. I anticipate identifying the viral determinants and delineating the signaling \npathway associated by which human and murine rotaviruses establish s uccessful infection in human \nand mouse intestinal epithelial cells, respectively. Additionally, I plan to tackle two outstanding \nquestions in the rotavirus field: the identification of a yet -to-be-discovered proteinaceous receptor for \nhuman rotaviruses and  the improvement of suboptimal rotavirus vaccine efficacy in low -to-middle -\nincome countries. These ambitious projects, to be supported by NIH R01 grants, are poised to yield \nimpactful insights into rotavirus replication, pathogenesis, and immunity. Further more, they will pave \nSiyuan Ding , Ph.D.  Curriculum Vitae     Page 13 the way for the rational design of improved next -generation vaccines and antiviral therapeutics \nagainst rotavirus, ultimately mitigating infection -associated morbidity and mortality. Finally, my plans \nextend to expanding my current res earch program beyond rotavirus and SARS -CoV-2 to include a \nthird enteric virus, whether it be non -cultivable group B rotaviruses, human noroviruses, or \nechoviruses. I aspire for my laboratory to be internationally recognized for its exceptional training \nenvironment, rigorous scientific output, and substantial contributions to the understanding of enteric \nviral pathogenesis and antiviral innate immunity.  \n \n ",
