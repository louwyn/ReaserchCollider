He completed all his degrees,\nincluding Ph.D., at the Harbin Institute of Technology in 2004. After carrying\nout extensive postdoctoral training at Tsinghua University, the University of\nSouth Carolina, and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), he became a staff\nscientist at LANL in 2010 and then joined SUNY-Buffalo as a tenure-track\nassistant professor in 2014. He was quickly promoted to a tenured associate\nprofessor in 2018 and a full professor in 2020.

I received\nmy Ph.D. degree in Computer Science Department, UIUC, advised by Prof. [Jiawei\nHan](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu). After that, I visited UW as a researcher\nand worked with Prof. [Hanna\nHajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/). Prior to UIUC, I\nreceived my Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering in Tsinghua University\nin 2018. My research interest broadly lies in the intersection of natural\nlanguage processing and machine learning, and I am especially interested in\nunderstanding the properties of **language models** as well as improving their\n**trustworthiness** and **efficiency**.\n\nI am looking for PhD students for 25’Fall and interns year-round!

In healthcare, AI models are frequently trained on real-world\ndata (RWD) to generate real-world evidence (RWE) or assist clinical decision-\nmaking. However, RWD are intricate, imperfect, and reflects existing health\ndisparities. To leverage AI effectively, it’s vital to develop methodologies\nthat address and correct the biases inherent in RWD. Our lab is committed to\nintegrating the disciplines of `causality` and `artificial intelligence` to\ngenerate `reliable real-world evidence` and to create `equitable clinical AI`\nmodels that serve all patient groups.\n\n## Join us\n\n**Post-doc Fellows** We are looking for one [postdoctoral\nfellow](https://linyingzhang.com/files/Postdoc.pdf) to work on causal AI for\nhealth care.\n\n**PhD Students** We are looking for 1-2 PhD students starting Fall 2024.\nPlease apply directly to the [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science\n(BIDS)](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biomedical-informatics-data-science/)\nPhD program at Washington University School of Medicine.

and\nother activities. Such tempo preference may reflect individual cognitive\nspeed, personality traits, and/or life styles, and thus determine the\nuniqueness of human behaviors.\n\nAs a researcher with psychology and neuroscience background and long-standing\ninterest in human brain and behaviors, currently, I am particularly interested\nin how human brain generates spontaneous/natural motor tempo, followed by why\npeople show the large individual differences on natural tempo preference, can\nwe predict such individual differences based on task-free and task-based\nneural activities during spontaneous movement activity.\n\nOur neural findings may provide seeds for behavioral/neural intervention via\nneuro-feedback or noninvasive brain stimulation. Our study may lead to\napps/software application and engineering products development to help to\nimprove general physical and mental health among both normal people and\npatients, i.e. tuning natural tempo into daily activities to optimize\nperformance or reduce stress/anxiety levels thus leading a natural life.  \n  \n![](media/images/Researcher/creative/suns/sunsai02.png)\n\nFig.1 Research outline framework\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n  * [![](media/images/Researcher/spacer300x190.png)Topics2023.05.29 Assistant Professor Sai Sun received Tohoku University ECEI Excellent Young Researcher Award (東北大](en/feature/topics/detail---id-1289.html)\n\nPAGE TOP\n\n### Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences\n\n  * ####  About FRIS \n\n    * [Greetings](en/about/greetings.html)\n    * [Overview](en/about/overview.html)\n    * [Missions](en/about/missions/)\n    * [Organization](en/about/organization.html)\n    * [Tenure track system in FRIS](en/about/tenure-track.html)\n    * [Maps & Directions](en/about/access.html)\n    * [Publication](en/about/publication/)\n    * [Annual Meeting](en/about/annualmeeting/)\n    * [Consultation Desk](en/about/consultation.html)\n    * [DEI Promotion](en/about/dei.html)\n  * ####  Researcher \n\n    * [Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Division](en/researcher/advanced/)\n    * [Creative Interdisciplinary Research Division](en/researcher/creative/)\n    * [Managing & Planning Division](en/researcher/managing/)\n    * [Endowed Research Divisions](en/researcher/endowed/)\n    * [Senior-advisor](en/researcher/senior-advisor/)\n    * [Visiting Professors / Collaborative Researchers](en/researcher/visiting-professors/)\n    * [Specially-appointed](en/researcher/specially-appointed/)\n    * [One-time members](en/researcher/creative_onetime/)\n\n####  Feature\n\n    * [Topics](en/feature/topics/)\n    * [FRIS Interviews](en/feature/interviews/)\n    * [FRIS Hub Meeting](en/feature/fris-hubmeeting/)\n  * ####  Research Programs \n\n    * [Open Research Proposal](en/research_programs/invitation/)\n    * [Research Projects](en/research_programs/research-project/)\n\n####  Recruit\n\n    * [Open Staff Positions](en/recruit/invitation/)\n    * [Useful Information for International Researchers](en/recruit/info_intlresearchers/)\n    * [FRIS Undergraduate Research Work Opportunities](en/recruit/fris-uro/)\n  * #### FRIS CoRE\n\n    * [FRIS CoRE](https://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fris_core/en/)\n\n#### FRIS Fund\n\n    * [FRIS Fund for Early-Career Independent Researchers](https://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fund/en/)\n  * #### External Links for Early Career Researcher Support\n\n    * [Division for Interdisciplinary Advanced Research and Education (DIARE)](http://www.iiare.tohoku.ac.jp/en/)\n    * [Ensemble Project for Early Career Researchers](https://web.tohoku.ac.jp/aric/english/)\n    * [Support Program for the Article Processing Charge](https://sites.google.com/tohoku.ac.jp/apc-kakudai/english)\n    * [webmail](https://mail.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/webmail/src/login.php)\n    * [LINK](en/about/link.html)\n    * [![](media/images/common/icon_fu_chan.svg)](http://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fris/katahira_fes/efu-house.html)\n    * [![TOHOKU UNIVERSITY](media/images/common/tohoku_univercity.png)](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/)\n\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/footer_jp02x.png)](https://twitter.com/TohokuUniv_FRIS)\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/footer_en02x.png)](https://twitter.com/FRIS_TohokuUniv)\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/2263covid2.png)](about/information_of_covid2019/)\n\nCopyrights © Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences,\nTohoku University All rights reserved.\n\nno cache\n\n|  \n---|---  \n|  \n---|---",

Iowa State Corn  yield forecast model  with PCA dimension reduction and Random Forest  algorithm.   \n    Use the historical Precipitation, Temperature and Sea Surface Temperature  (SST)  data to predict the annual corn \nyield of 9 Iowa Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs) through 1950 to 2015. The data is with very high dimensionalities \nand lar ge volumes  (96 locations in 714 month data for Precipitation and Temperature data; 2683 locations in 714 \nmonths for the SST data) . The PCA technique  is applied to reduce the data dimension ality.  \n    To evaluate the objective performance of the predictive model, a novel 10 -year running sampling framework is \nestablished. For the prediction of each year, only the previous 10 years data is applied in the training data set. The \nperformances of models are evaluated through all past 50 years. After deliberate com parison and analysis of various \nstatistical methods, the Random Forest model achieved best result. Except for a few years with extreme weather like \n1988 and 1993, the model exhibits very nice accuracy and strong reliability.  \n2. Rossmann Pharmacy Sales pred ictions  with time series analy sis and Random Forest algorithm.  \n    To predict the sales of Rossmann (one of the largest pharmacy store chain in Europe), the very large and complex \ndata (including promotions, competition, school and state holidays seasonali ty and locality informat ion of 1115 \nstores) are provided. After the data exploration and cleaning, a Random Forest model is established and achieved \nvery high accuracy (Cross Validation MSE ~ 0.01 of sales amount under log scale). The factor importance ana lysis \nand outlier analysis furthermore suggested the extreme weather condition is the most potential influential factor.  \n3. Prudential Life Insurance Assessment Analysis  with Ridge Regression method . \n    Prudential is one of the largest issuers of life ins urance in the USA. The model is built based on over a hundred \nvariables describing attributes of life insurance applicants, from demographic, health condition, Medical record to \ninsurance history, etc. To deal the high dimensional model, the Ridge Regressi on model is applied for the model \nselection. The model provides very nice accuracy.   \n4. SpringLeaf Market Response predictions  with feature selections algorithm . \n    Using a large set of anonymous features of customer information to build the predictive model on the customer \nresponse. To deal with the data with very high dimensions (1932 features with 145232 customers), different model \nselection and dimension reduc tion techniques are applied.\n\nSkip to main content\n\n  * [Get

I am an Instructor in the Department of OBGYN at\nWashington University in St. Louis with expertise in statistical data analysis\nand modeling development. With a broad background in biophysics and\nstatistics, I am interested in developing multi-level modeling and Machine\nLearning/Deep Learning methodologies for clinical studies and medical\nscientific research.  \n  \nMy research focuses on applying different modeling techniques in clinical\nstudies and developing novel computational models related to maternal and\nfetal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes, preterm birth prediction,\ncervical remodeling, and uterine maturation. I contributed to many projects in\nthe Prematurity Research Center, mainly focused on the March of Dimes 1000\nwomen cohort study to predict preterm birth. I developed a novel computational\nmethod to analyze actigraphy data and published an online application as an\nautomatic analytical tool. I established an innovative methodology for\nquantitatively measuring cervix tissue stiffness from transvaginal ultrasound\nimages. I also developed the statistical analysis methodology for\nElectromyometrial Imaging, a system with which uterine electrical activity can\nbe noninvasively measured and mapped onto the entire uterine surface in three\ndimensions.\n\n#### Poster(s):\n\n  * [(608) Fully quantitative numeric cervical softening device at 37 weeks: Information for labor management decision making?](/ajaxcalls/PosterInfo.asp?PosterID=643886)\n\n__Tuesday, February 13, 2024\n\n__3:30 PM – 5:00 PM\n\n  * [(682) Neighborhood, race, or both?

agricultural origins, and prehistoric food globalization.\n\nMy research focuses on plant domestication, agricultural origins, and human-\nmediated adaptation of domesticated species. My work contributed to the recent\nmomentum in understanding the globalization of food in deep antiquity and its\nbiological and social consequences. It has also prompted a reconsideration of\nglobal prehistory with greater appreciation of the presence of the East and\nGlobal South. I have conducted fieldwork on the Tibetan Plateau, in the Hexi\nCorridor, Inner Mongolia, and regions across Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\nIt highlights the relevance of archaeological investigations to contemporary\nchallenges and draws inspirations from humanity at its deepest levels.\n\nMy recent work centers on the domestication of millet—a generic term for\nsmall-grained cereals—that has been historically significant across extensive\nbiogeographies, sustaining ancient populations in the Global South. Today,\nmillet is consumed less frequently in the developed world, thus attracting\nlittle scientific attention compared to their high-yielding, large-grained\ncounterparts. However, given their ecological merit and deep community roots,\nmillets are among the key solutions to achieving food security and\nsustainability.\n\nI serve as a permanent committee member of the International Work Group of\nPaleoethnobotany and am an Associate Editor of journals _Environmental\nArchaeology_ and _Archaeological Research in Asia_. Additionally, I am on the\neditorial boards of _PLOS ONE_ , _Frontiers in Plant Science_ , and _Frontiers\nin Environmental Archaeology_.\n\nMembers of my lab group, the [Laboratory for the Analysis of Early Food-Webs\n(LAEF)](http://sites.wustl.edu/earlyfoodwebs/), utilize a multidisciplinary\napproach to bear upon questions related to nutrition and ecology, paleodiet\nand paleoenvironment. They conduct research in a diverse range of\nenvironments, including the Tibetan Plateau, Lower Yangtze, Kazakhstan, Mayan\nlowland, the Andes and Costa Rica.\n\n**SELECTED PUBLICATIONS (see CV for the full list and**[ **google\nscholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xGtNQ1kAAAAJ&hl=en) **)**\n\nZhang, Z., H.

An \nactigraph is a watch -like device attached to the wrist t hat uses an accelerometer to \nmeasure movement nearly continuously over several days. An American Academy of \n 4\n Sleep Medicine 2002 report defines the practice parameters for the use of actigraphy as a \nuseful tool for detecting sleep in healthy individuals, as sessing specific aspects in \ninsomnia and restless leg syndrome, and a useful adjunct to a detailed history and \nsubjective sleep diary for diagnosing and treating insomnia, circadian -rhythm disorders, \nand excessive sleepiness. Concurrent with these recommen dations is an increased interest \nin the use of actigraphy as a tool for objectively measuring fatigue. With improved high -\nend statistical methods for analyzing this data, actigraphy has the potential to become \nmore important as an objective diagnostic tool  for determining fatigue, sleep \nabnormalities and assessing response to treatment. Other special areas of neurology and \nmedicine where actigraphy can be used more effectively include restless leg syndrome, \nthe elderly and nursing home patients with and wit hout dementia, newborns, infants, \nchildren, and adolescents, hypertensive individuals, depressed or schizophrenic patients, \nand individuals in in accessible situations.   \nRole:  Co-Investigator  \n \n Current  \nR01 AG034119 -01A1    PI: Xiong, Chengjie   8/01/2010 -7/31/2015  \nNIH/NIA  \nTwo Preclinical Latent Scores to Predict Occurrence of DAT  \nThis project will determine the earliest preclinical cognitive changes prior to the \nsymptomatic onset of  AD, and associate such changes with a wide spectrum of \nbiomarkers (CSF, PIB, MRI).  \nRole: Co -Investigator  \n \n Pending  \n \nNSF- SES- Methodolog y, Measurement, and Statistics  \nFunctional Trend and Variability in Clustered Longitudinal Studies.  \nRole: PI  \n \nAlzheimer's Association – New Investigator Research Grant  \nEarly Detection of Alzhei mer's Disease with Multimodal Markers . \nRole: PI  \n \nCollaboration and Consulting:  \n \n Summer Institute for Training in Biostatistics, Washington University in St.Louis, \nSchool of Medicine, 2012  \n-- A program sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and \nthe National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), in which I am one of the \ninstructors . \n Statistical Consultant for the law firm of “Rosenblum, Goldenhesh, Silverstein & Zafft”,       \nClayton, MO, 63105, 2012  \n-- I provide statistical analyses for some of their lawsuits.  \n Clayton School District Mathematical Program Review, 2012  \n 5\n -- A consulting project for the Clayton school district (MO), in which I am in charge of \nstatistical analysis fo r their math program review.   \n \n USRDS (United States Renal Data System) Erythropoietin Index project & Myocardial \nInfarction project, 2004 -2006  \n--A collaboration with medical researchers, in which I am responsible for data analysis \nof a large observationa l study (more than 10 GB of data), developing SAS MACROs, \nfitting survival and varying -coefficient statistical models and writing statistical reports.  \n Entomology butterfly project, 2005  \n Consultant for STAT LAB, Summer 2003  \n \nTeaching Experience:   \n  \n Students:  \nLan Xu (Master, May, 2013 ) \nAdam Cheng (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, Dec., 2012)  \nDan Kowal (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, May, 2012)  \nArtem Kreimer (Undergraduate Honor Thesis, May, 2012)  \n \n Washington University  \n \nSemiparametric Statistics (Math 533)  \nTheories in Statistics (Math 5061, 5062)  \nAdvanced Linear Models (Math 4392)  \nProbability (Math 493)  \nMathematical Statistics (Math 494)  \nStatistical Computation (Math 475)  \nSurvival Analysis (Math 434)  \nMatrix Algebra (Math 309)  \n \n UC Davis (As an Instructor)  \n \nProbability Modeling (STA 102), Introduction to Statistics (STA 13)  \n \n As a Teaching Assistant:  \n \nLongitudinal Data Analysis (G) ,Introduction to Probability Theory (U), Time Series \nAnalysis (U), Analysis of Variance (U), Probability Modeling (U), Elementary \nStatistics (U), Probability & Statistics in Engineering (U)  \n \nDepartment Committees:  \n Statistics committee chair: 2012 -2013  \n Statistics committee, 2006 -2013  \n Undergraduate committee, 2011 -2012  \n Special lecture committee, 2009 -2010  \n Departmental colloquium commit tee chair, 2008 -2009  \n Statistical seminar organizer, 2007 -2009  \n Graduate screening committee, 2006 -2008  \n 6\n  Graduate student independence studies, 2006 -2008  \n \n \nAcademic Service:  \n \n Editorial Work: referee for  \no Annals of Statistics  \no Journal of American Statistical Association  \no Annals of Applied Statistics  \no Biometrics,  \no Statistica Sinica,  \no Life Time Data,  \no Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation,  \no Books published by Springer.  \no Scandinavian Journal of Statistics,  \no Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference,  \n \n Conference Session Chair: Institute of Mathematical Statistics Asia Pacific Rim \nMeeting, Tsukuba, Japan, July 2012.  \n Conference Session Chair and Organizer: Joint Statistical Meetings, San Diego, CA, \nAug. 2012.  \n Conference Session Chair, First Joint Biostati stics Symposium, Beijing, July, 2010.  \n Conference Session Chair: 2009 ICSA Applied Statistical Symposium, San Francisco, \nCA, June, 2009.  \n Conference Organization: I assisted in organizing the Focused Research Group \nConference  in Aug. 2005.

Personal Statement I am an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine, starting from September 2024. I am highly motivated to pursue an academic career in vision science, especially in eye development and diseases. My PhD training in molecular biology and cell biology, together with my postdoctoral training in ophthalmology and mouse genetics, has equipped me with the skills to successfully conduct research in this field. I obtained my PhD degree in Physiology with Dr. Xing-Zhen Chen at University of Alberta. I studied the interactions of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network, using in vitro cell culture models. I identified novel binding partners of membrane proteins, including Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel TRPP2 and Epithelium Sodium Channel (ENaC), and further demonstrated the regulatory roles of cytoskeleton on channel function. This research provided me with extensive experience in strategies used in molecular biology and cell biology, which will be valuable for conducting mechanistic studies in my further research. When I joined Dr. Xin Zhang’s lab at Columbia University as a postdoctoral researcher, I began to study how Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling regulates lens and lacrimal gland development. I received comprehensive training in mouse genetics and various aspects of eye development and diseases. My published work has provided insights into how FGF signalling is propagated1 and its role in lens development2, and has also elucidated the unique functions of FGF downstream cascades including mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)4, and phospholipase Cg (PLCg)5 pathways, in lacrimal gland development.  With a solid background in studying signaling networks using mouse genetics, my long-term research goal is to explore the role of lipid signaling networks in eye development. As an initial step toward this goal, I propose to establish a mouse model to investigate the role of the lipid phosphatase OCRL, whose deficiency causes a genetic disorder with ocular manifestations in humans. Ongoing and recently completed projects that I would like to highlight include:  K99EY032171-01A Role: PI 06/2022-08/2028 Signaling networks and transcriptional programs in lens vesicle formation   \n Citations: 1.

Contribution to Science PhD career \n1. Discovery of the dynamics of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network. My PhD study was mainly focused on studying the structural and functional interactions of membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton network. 1) I have identified a cytoskeletal protein filamin-A as a novel binding partner of polycystin-2, the mutations of which account for ~15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). I further discovered a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism of the polycystin-2 and filamin-A complex. These publications have contributed to the ADPKD field by suggesting a dynamic working model of polycystin-2 and the cytoskeletons. 2) I also systematically characterized the structural and functional interaction between the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and filamin. This work suggests a link between ENaC and ADPKD through the cytoskeleton.  a. Wang Q, Dai XQ, Li Q, Wang Z, Cantero Mdel R, Li S, Shen J, Tu JC, Cantiello H, Chen XZ.

PubMed Central PMCID: PMC4393133.  2. Identification of Cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of the polycystic proteins. In collaboration with colleagues, we systematically studied the role of 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of PKD2, which encodes polycystin-2, and found that both UTRs contain critical motifs that control polycystin-2 translation. This work elucidated the mechanisms underlying translational regulation of polycystin-2. We also identified polycystin-2L1 (also called TRPP3) as a novel regulatory target of the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1). The property of TRPP3 channel in response to calcium and acid was further characterized in the Xenopus oocyte model. This work elucidates the mechanisms of functional regulation of TRPP3 channel. a.

PubMed PMID: 23985800.  Post-doctoral career 3. Dissecting the role of FGF downstream cascades in lacrimal gland development. My postdoctoral research is focused on how FGF downstream cascades regulate lacrimal gland development. 1) I showed that FGF induced PI3K signaling restricts EGF receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region and demonstrated that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for the induction of lacrimal gland buds. 2) I found that Phospholipase Cγ regulates lacrimal gland branching by competing with PI3K in phosphoinositide metabolism. This work has been awarded the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) postdoctoral fellowship in 2018-2020. 3) In collaboration with colleagues, we demonstrated the role of Etv (also called Pea3) transcription factors in lacrimal gland cell fate determination. We found that loss of Pea3 family genes biased the lacrimal gland epithelium toward an epidermal cell fate. This study resolves the long-standing conundrum of how FGF induces the lacrimal gland fate, providing directives for lacrimal gland regeneration for future treatment of dry eye diseases.  \na.

In collaboration with colleagues, 1) we investigated how FGF signaling is propagated through its adaptor protein complex. We found that Shc1 collaborates with Frs2 and Shp2 to target Grb2 in FGF signaling in lens development (accepted in Elife). 2) we studied the role of FGF downstream transcription factors Etv family members. We elucidated a functional divergence between FGF signaling and its downstream signal regulated transcription factors Etv genes in lens development.  a.

Discovery of the signaling networks in lens vesicle formation. 1) In collaboration with colleagues, we found that Abelson kinase regulates FGF signaling to promote the tension-mediated lens vesicle separation (under revision in Science Advances). 2) I identified mTOR signaling as a novel regulator in lens vesicle separation process, and I am currently investigating the mechanisms of mTOR-mediated lens vesicle separation (K99/R00 proposal). This research will uncover the mTOR signaling networks during lens vesicle development, which is novel and significant in the field of lens development. a.

Research\n\nShare this Story:\n\n![]()\n\n__\n\nA Brown School professor is joining forces with St. Louis community leaders to\nteach the rudiments of Artificial Intelligence to a wide array of local\naudiences with a variety of interests. He discovered just how varied the\nappetite for AI is when a dozen students from the Missouri School for the\nBlind showed up to participate in a session he led at a branch of the St.\nLouis Public Library on creating art with AI.\n\n“They were absolutely amazing,” said the associate professor, [Ruopeng\nAn](https://brownschool.washu.edu/faculty-and-research/ruopeng-an/ \"Ruopeng\nAn\"). “After the lecture, they practiced on the computer. The AI system\ngenerated artwork that was a reflection of themselves.”\n\nThe event, recently released on\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1d2LuR0xjc&ab_channel=HECEducation),\nattracted 29 participants from around the St. Louis area, with more sessions\nto come, according to An, as part of the school’s [Open\nClassroom](https://brownschool.washu.edu/resources-initiatives/professional-\ndevelopment/?selected_category=open-classroom \"Open Classroom\"), Artificial\nIntelligence Applications for Health Data Adult Learning Certificate (ALC),\nand the Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics for Public Health\n(AIBDA) certificate program. The idea was sparked by Sarah Sims, assistant\ndirector of [Professional\nDevelopment](https://brownschool.washu.edu/resources-initiatives/professional-\ndevelopment/ \"Professional Development\"), whose husband is on staff at the St.\nLouis Library. An was approached to offer local training, and brought his\nstudents to the library to help.\n\nThe event gave people their first taste of AI. “They had heard of it, but\nnever experienced the power of AI for themselves,” An said. He said creating\nart was a great way to showcase that power, and suitable for students of all\nages – more than half were under 18. The lecture provided guidance on how to\nwrite “prompts” for AI to use. The students generated artworks printed at the\nlibrary and mailed home.\n\nIn addition to the library events, An plans to offer training sessions to non-\nprofit organizations in the St. Louis area through Delmar DivINe. He will\noffer an AI workshop in April at the St. Louis Modern Chinese School for\nstudents and their parents.\n\nMary Meyer, manager of Digital Services for the St. Louis Public Library, said\nthe November program at the Julia Davis branch was “a perfect space” for the\nworkshop. The library offers digital maker spaces that focus on creativity and\nbringing together community resources. “We’ve seen a huge use of these\nresources,” she said. “The AI workshop was really engaging, everyone was\nexcited to create something, and our staff had so much fun seeing what people\nwere creating. We would definitely hope to host another AI event in the\nfuture.”\n\nOne participant was Rachel Tang, a high school senior who’ll be attending\nWashington University in the fall. She plans to major in environmental\nanalysis, but has a side interest in art. “I thought it would be a good\nintroduction to AI,” she said. “It was really interesting to see how you can\nuse words to come up with an art piece. It really opened up a new door for my\nart hobby.”\n\n## You may also enjoy:\n\n  * [![](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/05/newsuganda-680x422.jpg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/postdoctoral-researcher-addresses-intimate-partner-violence-and-hiv-treatment-in-uganda/)\n\n### Postdoctoral researcher addresses intimate partner violence and HIV\ntreatment in Uganda\n\n[Read this story ![Arrow Link\nImage](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/link-\narrow.svg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/postdoctoral-researcher-\naddresses-intimate-partner-violence-and-hiv-treatment-in-uganda/)\n\n  * [![](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/05/1newsanigi-680x422.gif)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/student-speaker-celebrates-resilience-and-hope-at-brown-school-recognition-ceremony/)\n\n### Student speaker celebrates resilience and hope at Brown School Recognition\nCeremony\n\n[Read this story ![Arrow Link\nImage](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/link-\narrow.svg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/student-speaker-celebrates-\nresilience-and-hope-at-brown-school-recognition-ceremony/)\n\n[![WashU Brown School 100\nBanner](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/WashU_Brown_School_100_Banner_RGB-\nfilled.png)](/washu-brown-school-100/ \"Brown School Centennial\")\n\n#### Quick Links:\n\n  * [Apply](https://brownschool.washu.edu/admissions-aid/apply/)\n  * [About Brown School](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://brownschool.washu.edu/contact-us/)\n  * [Directions](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/directions/)\n  * [Academic Professional Integrity Policy](https://brownschool.washu.edu/academics/academic-professional-integrity/)\n  * [Native Land Acknowledgement](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/native-land-acknowledgement/)\n\n![Washington University\nLogo](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/wustl-\nlogo.png)  \n[WashU.edu ](https://washu.edu \"Washington University Website\")\n\nKeep Up with Our Latest  \nNews, Research and Insights:\n\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/@WashUbrownschool \"youtube\")\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@washubrownschool \"tiktok\")\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/washubrownschool/ \"facebook\")\n  * [](https://www.instagram.com/washubrownschool/ \"instagram\")\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/washubrownschool/ \"linkedin\")\n\nFounded in 1925, the George Warren Brown School was named with a generous gift\nfrom Betty Bofinger Brown in memory of her late husband.  \n  \nCopyright 2025 by WashU Brown School  Washington University • One Brookings\nDrive  \n• St. Louis, MO 63130\n\nNotifications",

Over the past five years, \nmy laboratory has established a strong track record of studying rotavirus -host interactions, SARS -\nCoV-2 intestinal infection, and antiviral immunity at mucosal surfaces. My strategic vision for the next \nfive years involves leveraging the rotavirus reverse genetics system, primary intestinal organoid \ncultures, and a neonatal mouse model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying rotavirus \nhost range restriction. I anticipate identifying the viral determinants and delineating the signaling \npathway associated by which human and murine rotaviruses establish s uccessful infection in human \nand mouse intestinal epithelial cells, respectively. Additionally, I plan to tackle two outstanding \nquestions in the rotavirus field: the identification of a yet -to-be-discovered proteinaceous receptor for \nhuman rotaviruses and  the improvement of suboptimal rotavirus vaccine efficacy in low -to-middle -\nincome countries. These ambitious projects, to be supported by NIH R01 grants, are poised to yield \nimpactful insights into rotavirus replication, pathogenesis, and immunity. Further more, they will pave \nSiyuan Ding , Ph.D.  Curriculum Vitae     Page 13 the way for the rational design of improved next -generation vaccines and antiviral therapeutics \nagainst rotavirus, ultimately mitigating infection -associated morbidity and mortality. Finally, my plans \nextend to expanding my current res earch program beyond rotavirus and SARS -CoV-2 to include a \nthird enteric virus, whether it be non -cultivable group B rotaviruses, human noroviruses, or \nechoviruses. I aspire for my laboratory to be internationally recognized for its exceptional training \nenvironment, rigorous scientific output, and substantial contributions to the understanding of enteric \nviral pathogenesis and antiviral innate immunity.\n\nSkip to content Skip to search Skip to footer\n\n[ WashU Medicine ](https://medicine.washu.edu)\n\n# S.

My main tool is a \"Particle-in-Cell\" code Aperture that I developed as\na part of my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/fizban007/Thesis). It simulates\nultra-relativistic plasmas in strong electromagnetic fields, and their\ninteraction with high-energy radiation. The code runs on GPUs, is highly\noptimized, and enables me to run simulations on my personal workstation that\nwould otherwise take thousands of CPU cores. It also runs on the Summit\nsupercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Labs, parallelized over tens of\nthousands of GPUs. I also work on interactive visualizations of astrophysical\nsimulations in the modern browser.

Faculty](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/category/news/new-faculty/)\n\n# Dr. Xiucui Ma joins the Department of Medicine\n\nBy [Mary](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/author/callahanmary/ \"Posts by\nMary\") • March 20, 2023March 21, 2023\n\n![](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/app/uploads/2023/03/MaXiuccuiPhotoforwebsite-1024x678.jpg)\nXiucui Ma, PhD\n\nDr. Xiucui Ma joined the Department of Medicine in the Cardiovascular Division\nas an assistant professor in February 2023. Dr. Ma received her PhD in 2006\nfrom Zhejiang University through a joint program with Washington University\nSchool of Medicine, where she trained in molecular biology and gene therapy.\nAfter graduation, she pursued postdoctoral research training in gene therapy\nfor disorders such as mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), which are lysosomal storage\ndisorders, in Dr. Katherine Ponder’s lab in the Department of Medicine at\nWashington University School of Medicine. During this phase, she gained\nvaluable experience and acquired skills in cell biology, molecular biology,\nvirology, immunology, and biochemistry, in both the in-vitro and in-vivo model\nsystems. Subsequently, she transitioned to the role of a staff scientist under\nthe supervision of Dr. Samuel L. Stanley, the former Vice-chancellor for\nResearch at Washington University, in the Infectious Diseases division of the\nDepartments of Medicine and Molecular Microbiology.\n\nShe studied the biological mechanisms by which cells respond to infectious\nagents such as amoebae, and the molecular underpinnings of the inflammatory\nresponse. Fascinated by the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease,\nshe transferred to Dr. Abhinav Diwan’s lab as a staff scientist in 2009 and\ngrew in the ranks to lead a senior scientist in 2014-2022 in his program.\nDuring this period, she studied the role of lysosomal pathways in cellular\nhomeostasis and under stress in cardiac pathophysiology. Together with Dr.\nDiwan, she led a talented team that uncovered evidence for dysregulation of\nthe lysosome machinery as a major contributor in myocardial ischemia-\nreperfusion injury and described intermittent fasting as a strategy to\nstimulate lysosome function in vivo. She further demonstrated the intermittent\nfasting stimulates activation of transcription factor EB, a master regulator\nof the lysosome biogenesis program, to rescue advanced cardiomyopathy\ntriggered by genetic mutations that cause protein aggregate pathology and\ndesminopathies.\n\nShe also discovered the role of an innate immunity effector, TRAF2, which\nfunctions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to drive mitophagy and prevent\ninflammation to maintain cardiac myocyte homeostasis. Her collaborative\nefforts helped uncover evidence for acquired lysosome dysfunction in various\nCNS cell types in Alzheimer’s disease; whereby enhancing flux through the\nautophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is an attractive therapeutic option to\nattenuate amyloid plaque pathology. Drawing upon her comprehensive knowledge\nand experience in both basic sciences and biomedical research, she is\ninterested in mechanistically probing lysosome biology and developing targeted\nstrategies to harness lysosome function to treat diseases, in her role as a\nResearch Assistant Professor, in Dr. Abhinav Diwan’s research program. Dr.\nMa’s primary research interest is in defining the molecular and cellular\nmechanisms of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and in development of novel\ntherapeutic approaches targeting lysosome function to treat cardiac and\nmetabolic diseases.\n\n## WashU Medicine Department of Medicine\n\nWashU Medicine\n\nOffice Location: 4960 Children’s Place, Suite 6602\n\nMailing Address: 660 S.

of Gastroenterology at Washington\nUniversity in July in 2022. Dr. Cao was born in Chengdu in Southwestern China.\nAfter college at Zhejiang University, China, Dr. Cao entered the PhD program\nin Biochemistry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He then moved to New\nYork where he obtained MD at Columbia University. Afterwards, he completed his\nresidency in internal medicine at the University of California San Francisco\nand gastroenterology fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr.\nCao’s main research interests are in the mucosal immunity and biomarker\ndiscovery in inflammatory bowel disease. His clinical interests include colon\ncancer screening, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia and gastroesophageal\nreflux disease. He serves as an Associate Editor for _Inflammation_ and is on\nthe Editorial Board of _Inflammatory Bowel Diseases_. He is on external\ncommittees including National Scientific Advisory Committee of the Crohn’s &\nColitis Foundation and Executive Committee of the Southern Society for\nClinical Investigation.\n\n## Research Interests\n\nI am broadly interested in disease-related cellular and molecular pathways in\ninflammation of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel disease\n(IBD, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), IBD-associated tumorigenesis,\nand eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). I am fascinated by the inter-connection of\nthese pathologically distinctive diseases. We strive to uncover the pathogenic\nmechanisms and identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets using molecular and\ncell biology, multi-omics technologies (e.g., single-cell and spatial\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, whole-genome/exome sequencing, metagenomics),\npreclinical models, and human tissues. Our current projects include: 1) Innate\nlymphoid cells (ILCs) in murine IBD; 2) Innate immune mechanisms in perianal\nand stricturing Crohn’s disease; 3) Multi-omics of IBD-related complications;\n4) Biomarker discovery for IBD therapies (e.g., anti-IL-23s); 5) ILCs and\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in IBD-associated colorectal cancer;\n6) ILC2s in murine and human EoE. My laboratory is currently supported by the\nNIH, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation, American Gastroenterological Association,\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, and Washington University Institute of\nClinical and Translational Sciences.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n#### Selected Publications\n\n  * Yangzhuangzhuang Zhu, **Siyan Cao**.

Dr. Ding's research focuses on integrating cancer\nproteogenomics (including single cell and spatial omics), patient-derived\ncancer models, functional genomics, and drug development to advance cancer\nbiology and precision medicine. This work spans many cancer types, including\nacute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer,\nprostate cancer, glioblastoma, and multiple myeloma, with key findings\nincluding the identification and characterization of pathogenic germline\nvariants and somatic cancer drivers, and discovery of age-related clonal\nhematopoiesis. Her research team has also developed widely-used computational\ntools, including VarScan, SciClone, BreakDancer, MSIsensor, Pindel-C,\nHotSpot3D, and MuSiC and she plays significant roles and co-chairs various\ngroups within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome\nConsortium (ICGC), the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC),\nthe Patient-Derived Xenografts Development and Trial Centers Research Network\n(PDXNet), Patient Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS), Cellular\nSenescence Network (SenNet), and Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). She also\nserves on the Steering Committees of CPTAC, TCGA, PDXnet, PE-CGS, SenNet, and\nco-chairs the HTAN Steering Committee. Dr. Ding has been recognized several\ntimes among Thomson-Reuters’ surveys of influential researchers, including\nlisting among “The World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds”, and was a\nmember of a group honored with the American Association of Cancer Research\nTeam Science Award for contributions to TCGA. Her work continues to be\ninspired by the ultimate goal of making personalized medicine a reality for\ncancer patients.\n\n# Group photos\n\n![January

Her teaching and research interests\ninclude modern Chinese literature, with a particular focus on autobiographical\nwritings and practices from the late Qing and early Republican periods, as\nwell as language pedagogy, heritage cultural learning and content-based\ncurriculum development.\n\nLu began her journey as a language instructor while serving as a teaching\nassistant for language courses during her graduate studies at WashU, where she\ndiscovered her passion for teaching. After graduation, she served as a Chinese\nlanguage lecturer at Princeton University for over five years. She has taught\nChinese language courses at all levels, including both heritage and non-\nheritage tracks, as well as advanced-level content-based courses in modern and\nclassical Chinese literature, classical Chinese philosophy, and modern Chinese\nintellectual history. Additionally, she has taught at the Princeton in Beijing\nprogram and the Middlebury Summer Chinese School.\n\nLu's academic background profoundly influences her approaches to language\nteaching. She is particularly interested in integrating her research on self-\nwriting and storytelling into curriculum development. Lu hopes to facilitate\nstudents in finding their own voices and expressing their individual\nexperiences and thoughts while studying Chinese language.\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [Resources](/resources)\n  * [Events](/events)\n  * [Careers & Outcomes](https://ealc.wustl.edu/careers-outcomes)\n  * [Our People](/faculty-staff)\n  * [Alumni](https://ealc.wustl.edu/alumni)\n  * [Contact](/get-in-touch-ealc)\n\n### Additional information\n\n  * [ Arts & Sciences](https://artsci.washu.edu)\n  * [ Graduate Studies in A&S](https://gradstudies.artsci.wustl.edu)\n\n _Copyright 2025 by:_ Arts & Sciences at Washington  \nUniversity in St. Louis\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/washuartsci)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WUSTLEALC/)\n  * [Twitter](https://x.com/washuartsci)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@washuartsci)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/washu-arts-sciences/)\n\n_Contact Us:_\n\nEast Asian Languages and Cultures  \n[ealc@wustl.edu](mailto:ealc@wustl.edu)\n\n[Visit the main Washington University in St. Louis\nwebsite](https://washu.edu/)1 Brookings Drive / St. Louis, MO 63130 /\nwashu.edu",

These systems guard\nagainst external and internal insults on the genome and transcriptome by\nrepairing damaged DNA structures or by eliminating faulty RNA molecules.\nDefects in these systems can alter the functions of the cell and cause many\nhuman diseases. A prominent example is cancer, which is characterized by\ngenomic instability, aberrant gene expression and uncontrolled cell\nproliferation.\n\nOur lab investigates the molecular mechanisms of the **_replication stress\nresponse_** and the **_DNA damage response_**. We are also interested in an\nRNA surveillance pathway called **_nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD)_** and\nits interplay with DNA surveillance mechanisms. We utilize a combination of\ncell biological, biochemical and imaging approaches and techniques to decipher\nkey mechanisms of the DNA/RNA surveillance networks with the goal to improve\nthe understanding and treatment of cancer.\n\n* * *\n\n## News\n\n[Tweets by YouLab_WashU](https://twitter.com/YouLab_WashU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n##  [October 1, 2024](https://youlab.wustl.edu/september-9-2024/)\n\nYutong Geng has joined our lab for her rotation.

One of the major symptoms of migraine, the\nrecurring headache, is highly debilitating, poorly understood and difficult to\ntreat. A significant proportion of patients have headaches that are not\nresponsive to current therapies and increase in frequency over time,\neventually becoming chronic migraine.\n\nResearch in our lab focuses on understanding the mechanisms of episodic and\nchronic migraine from both cellular and systems neuroscience perspectives. We\nemploy a multidisciplinary approach including state-of-the-art technologies in\nelectrophysiology, time-lapse imaging, anatomical tracing, single neuron\nprofiling as well as mouse genetics and behavioral assays. Current research\nprojects include:\n\n1) To understand how migraine-associated ion channel mutations affect channel\nbiophysics, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and ultimately the\nencoding of headache.\n\n2) To study the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the transition\nfrom episodic to chronic migraine in mouse models.\n\n3) To investigate how the innate and adaptive immune systems modulate the\nneuronal circuits underlying migraine headache.\n\nThrough these mechanistic studies, we hope to identify novel molecular and\ncellular targets for the development of new abortive and prophylactic\ntherapeutics for migraine and other primary headache disorders.\n\n[![](https://dbrcaolab.wustl.edu/files/2019/01/research_main-23vmfta.jpeg)](https://dbrcaolab.wustl.edu/files/2019/01/research_main-23vmfta.jpeg)\n\n## Cao Lab\n\n[WashU Medicine Department of\nAnesthesiology](https://anesthesiology.wustl.edu/)\n\n660 S.

post-translational modifications that indicate islet dysfunction\n\n## Research Interests\n\nOur laboratory focuses on examining pathogenic events responsible for\ninitiating the development of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases. We\nprimarily employ mouse experimental models to mechanistically dissect key\nfactors involved in type 1 diabetes, a deteriorating autoimmune disorder that\neventually destroys insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets. The\nresearch projects center on 1) Identifying antigenic targets involved in\ndisease pathogenesis, which not only serves as a platform for activating\nantigen-specific autoreactive T cells but also can be used as diagnostic and\ntherapeutic targets; 2) Examining the biological behaviors of the tissue\ninnate immune system that finely tunes tissue homeostasis and shapes the\nphenotypic signatures of localized autoimmunity.\n\nWe recently identified a specific site in pancreatic β cells, the crinosomes,\nresponsible for generating disease-relevant peptides. Crinosomes are a\nspecific set of vesicles formed by fusion of insulin granules with lysosomes.\nAs an enzyme-rich structure, crinosomes not only generate unique or “cryptic”\nepitopes from degraded protein segments but also produce neoepitopes formed by\npost-translational modifications. These immunogenic materials are released\ninto circulation during β-cell degranulation and become an antigen source for\nsensitizing peripheral lymphoid tissues. We aim to better understand crinosome\nbiology and apply this knowledge to diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of type\n1 diabetes. Using a platform integrating mass spectrometry with immunological\ncharacterization, we are moving forward to determine disease-relevant epitopes\nin the islets and peripheral blood from humans with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe pancreatic islet is a mini-organ essential for maintaining body\nmetabolism. This tissue contains several types of endocrine cells, including\nthe insulin-producing β cells, but only consists of one immune cell, the\nresident macrophages. Lineage tracing studies indicate that islet macrophages\nderive from definitive hematopoiesis. The islet macrophages are in intimate\ncontact with β cells, extending long filopodia in between them. Some of these\nfilopodia enter the blood lumen and can capture microparticles. Islet\nmacrophages isolated from different mouse strains (NOD, NOD.Rag1–/–, B6) have\na high expression of genes encoding MHC-II, costimulatory molecules, and\ninflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We consider such an activation state as\na self-defensive mechanism for protecting the islets from pathogen infections.\nHowever, autoimmune risk can also be precipitated to foster incoming\nautoimmune responses. We seek to dissect the key factors expressed by the\nislet macrophages that not only influence β-cell biology during homeostasis\nbut also play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes.\n\n## DBBS Affiliation\n\n  * Immunology Program\n\n## Selected Publications\n\n[**PubMed Search**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Xiaoxiao+Wan)\n\n**Wan, X** , Thomas, JW, Unanue, ER.

We use a variety of structural biology, biochemistry,\ncell biology and mass spectrometry techniques to understand the structural\nmechanism of these membrane proteins. Structural insights give us a novel\nangle to elucidate the actions of these proteins in cellular settings. Deep\nunderstanding of protein structure and function often has implications\nsignificant for human disease.

The division’s emphasis is on high impact projects that are\ncommensurate with our capabilities and resources. Over the years, we have\nprovided the leadership in several significant developments in radiation\ntherapy, and we are consistently recognized as one of the leading medical\nphysics groups in the world.\n\nPhysics faculty are active participants and lead numerous research activities\nin the department. Research includes image acquisition and reconstruction,\nfunctional/biological imaging, advanced treatment planning applications,\nquality assurance, instrumentation, and development of novel procedures and\ntreatment technologies, along with more fundamental physical and mathematical\nscience. Physics faculty collaborate with industry partners to develop\nemerging technology through Master Research and Services Agreements. The\ndivision has pioneered MR-guided therapy with adaptive planning, and has\nbecome a world leader in adaptive radiotherapy.

As we gain more knowledge about microglial biology—one\nof the fastest growing fields at the nexus of neuroscience, immunology and\nhematopoiesis, numerous fundamental questions remain to be answered, such as:\nHow is microglia fate specified? How do microglia develop? How heterogeneous\nare microglia? How do microglia age? How do microglia contribute to brain\ndevelopment, aging and disease?\n\nThe Li laboratory is broadly interested in neuroimmunology with a focus on\nmicroglial biology. Particularly, the lab is interested in combining cutting-\nedge single-cell genomic technologies with in vitro and in vivo genetic,\nmolecular and cellular tools to investigate microglial development,\nheterogeneity and mechanisms of neuro-immune interactions underlying brain\nstructure and disease. We try to address two major questions: (1) how\nmicroglia (and other immune cells) are different in development, homeostasis\nand aging, and related to that, how these different populations of microglia\ninteract with other neural cells to control brain development and functioning;\n(2) how microglial fate is specified and diverged from other tissue\nmacrophages during early embryonic development. By studying these questions,\nthe overarching goal is to gain a better understanding of microglial functions\nin the establishment of the nervous system, as well as how changes in these\nfunctions contribute to neurological diseases.\n\n* * *\n\n## Selected publications\n\n  * Barclay KM, Abduljawad N, Cheng Z, Kim MW, Zhou L, Yang J, Rustenhoven J, Mazzitelli JA, Smyth LCD, Kapadia D, Brioschi S, Beatty W, Hou J, Saligrama N, Colonna M, Yu G, Kipnis J, Li Q.

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral\nassociate in the Supertech research group in MIT CSAIL. I received my S.M. and\nPh.D. from MIT, under the supervision of [Prof. Charles E.\nLeiserson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/). I received my Bachelor of\nScience in Computer Science from [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/), where I\nworked on the Simultaneous Multithreading Simulator for DEC Alpha under the\nsupervision of [Prof. Dean Tullsen](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tullsen/).\n\n## Research Interests\n\nMy research agenda is to make parallel programming accessible for everyone, so\nthat every programmer, particularly the non-experts, can rapidly develop high\nperformance software that takes advantage of commodity multicore hardware. To\nthat end, I am interested in many aspects of parallel computing, including\ndesigning programming models and linguistic constructs to simplify parallel\nprogramming, developing runtime and operating system support to enable\nmultithreaded programs to execute efficiently, and building software tools to\naid debugging and performance engineering of multithreaded code.\n\n## Teaching\n\n  * Concepts in Multicore Computing (G)  \nInstructor for Spring 2015, 2018, and 2020, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Current Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/cse539)  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse539/spr18)\n\n  * Introduction to Systems Software (U)  \nInstructor for Fall 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and Spring 2019, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse361/fall19)  \n\n  * Parallel and Sequential Algorithms (U/G)  \nInstructor (co-taught with [Prof. Kunal\nAgrawal](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/)) for Fall 2014, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse341/fall14)\n\n  * 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems (U)  \nInstructor (co-taught with [ Prof. Charles E.\nLeiserson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/)) for Fall 2012, MIT EECS  \n[ Course Page](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa12/6.172/index.html)\n\n## Conference and Journal Publications\n\n  * [ An Efficient Scheduler for Task-Parallel Interactive Applications](papers/ws-interactive.pdf)  \nKyle Singer, Kunal Agrawal, and I-Ting Angelina Lee  \nSPAA '23: Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms\nand Architectures, 2023  \n\n  * [ Responsive Parallelism with Synchronization](papers/responsive.pdf)  \nStefan K.

Specifically, Dr. Gao’s current\nresearch involves (1) the assessment of clinical prediction rules, (2) the\nprediction of survival outcome with time-dependent covariates, (3) growth\nmixture modeling of longitudinal data, and (4) joint modeling of longitudinal\nand survival data. He developed a joint model of longitudinal and survival\ndata to assess whether the fluctuation of intraocular pressure is an\nindependent predictor to the risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma.\nHe also developed a growth mixture model to identify distinct patterns of\nbiomarker trajectories and to monitor disease progression using multivariate\nlongitudinal biomarkers. He is currently providing statistical support for\ncancer-related studies in the Siteman Cancer Center. His responsibilities\ninclude study design, safety monitoring, data analysis, and\nmanuscript/abstract preparation.\n\n[NCBI Bibliography for Dr.\nGao](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/feng.gao.2/bibliography/41145090/public/?sort=date&direction=\ndescending)\n\n[Research Profile](https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/feng-gao)\n\nContact\n\n    \n\nComing soon.\n\n## Mary Culver Department of Surgery\n\n[WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/)\n\nMSC 8109-29-2300\n\n4590 Nash Way (formerly Children’s Place)\n\nSuite 2300\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63110\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WashUSurg)\n  * [Instagram](https://instagram.com/washusurg)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@WashUSurgery)\n\n©2025 Washington University in St. Louis\n\nNotifications",
