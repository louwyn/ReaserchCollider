Chen (陈雨然)\n\nAssistant Professor of Physics\n\nWashington University in St. Louis\n\nOne Brookings Drive, MSC 01105-0109-02, St. Louis, MO 63130\n\ncyuran (at) wustl.edu\n\nI am a theoretical astrophysicist using computer simulations to understand the\nphysics of the plasma near extreme objects such as neutron stars and black\nholes. My main tool is a \"Particle-in-Cell\" code Aperture that I developed as\na part of my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/fizban007/Thesis). It simulates\nultra-relativistic plasmas in strong electromagnetic fields, and their\ninteraction with high-energy radiation. The code runs on GPUs, is highly\noptimized, and enables me to run simulations on my personal workstation that\nwould otherwise take thousands of CPU cores. It also runs on the Summit\nsupercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Labs, parallelized over tens of\nthousands of GPUs. I also work on interactive visualizations of astrophysical\nsimulations in the modern browser.

In healthcare, AI models are frequently trained on real-world\ndata (RWD) to generate real-world evidence (RWE) or assist clinical decision-\nmaking. However, RWD are intricate, imperfect, and reflects existing health\ndisparities. To leverage AI effectively, it’s vital to develop methodologies\nthat address and correct the biases inherent in RWD. Our lab is committed to\nintegrating the disciplines of `causality` and `artificial intelligence` to\ngenerate `reliable real-world evidence` and to create `equitable clinical AI`\nmodels that serve all patient groups.\n\n## Join us\n\n**Post-doc Fellows** We are looking for one [postdoctoral\nfellow](https://linyingzhang.com/files/Postdoc.pdf) to work on causal AI for\nhealth care.\n\n**PhD Students** We are looking for 1-2 PhD students starting Fall 2024.\nPlease apply directly to the [Biomedical Informatics and Data Science\n(BIDS)](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/programs/biomedical-informatics-data-science/)\nPhD program at Washington University School of Medicine.

by\nMary\") • March 20, 2023March 21, 2023\n\n![](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/app/uploads/2023/03/MaXiuccuiPhotoforwebsite-1024x678.jpg)\nXiucui Ma, PhD\n\nDr. Xiucui Ma joined the Department of Medicine in the Cardiovascular Division\nas an assistant professor in February 2023. Dr. Ma received her PhD in 2006\nfrom Zhejiang University through a joint program with Washington University\nSchool of Medicine, where she trained in molecular biology and gene therapy.\nAfter graduation, she pursued postdoctoral research training in gene therapy\nfor disorders such as mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), which are lysosomal storage\ndisorders, in Dr. Katherine Ponder’s lab in the Department of Medicine at\nWashington University School of Medicine. During this phase, she gained\nvaluable experience and acquired skills in cell biology, molecular biology,\nvirology, immunology, and biochemistry, in both the in-vitro and in-vivo model\nsystems. Subsequently, she transitioned to the role of a staff scientist under\nthe supervision of Dr. Samuel L. Stanley, the former Vice-chancellor for\nResearch at Washington University, in the Infectious Diseases division of the\nDepartments of Medicine and Molecular Microbiology.\n\nShe studied the biological mechanisms by which cells respond to infectious\nagents such as amoebae, and the molecular underpinnings of the inflammatory\nresponse. Fascinated by the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease,\nshe transferred to Dr. Abhinav Diwan’s lab as a staff scientist in 2009 and\ngrew in the ranks to lead a senior scientist in 2014-2022 in his program.\nDuring this period, she studied the role of lysosomal pathways in cellular\nhomeostasis and under stress in cardiac pathophysiology. Together with Dr.\nDiwan, she led a talented team that uncovered evidence for dysregulation of\nthe lysosome machinery as a major contributor in myocardial ischemia-\nreperfusion injury and described intermittent fasting as a strategy to\nstimulate lysosome function in vivo. She further demonstrated the intermittent\nfasting stimulates activation of transcription factor EB, a master regulator\nof the lysosome biogenesis program, to rescue advanced cardiomyopathy\ntriggered by genetic mutations that cause protein aggregate pathology and\ndesminopathies.\n\nShe also discovered the role of an innate immunity effector, TRAF2, which\nfunctions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to drive mitophagy and prevent\ninflammation to maintain cardiac myocyte homeostasis. Her collaborative\nefforts helped uncover evidence for acquired lysosome dysfunction in various\nCNS cell types in Alzheimer’s disease; whereby enhancing flux through the\nautophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) is an attractive therapeutic option to\nattenuate amyloid plaque pathology. Drawing upon her comprehensive knowledge\nand experience in both basic sciences and biomedical research, she is\ninterested in mechanistically probing lysosome biology and developing targeted\nstrategies to harness lysosome function to treat diseases, in her role as a\nResearch Assistant Professor, in Dr. Abhinav Diwan’s research program. Dr.\nMa’s primary research interest is in defining the molecular and cellular\nmechanisms of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and in development of novel\ntherapeutic approaches targeting lysosome function to treat cardiac and\nmetabolic diseases.\n\n## WashU Medicine Department of Medicine\n\nWashU Medicine\n\nOffice Location: 4960 Children’s Place, Suite 6602\n\nMailing Address: 660 S.

of Gastroenterology at Washington\nUniversity in July in 2022. Dr. Cao was born in Chengdu in Southwestern China.\nAfter college at Zhejiang University, China, Dr. Cao entered the PhD program\nin Biochemistry at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He then moved to New\nYork where he obtained MD at Columbia University. Afterwards, he completed his\nresidency in internal medicine at the University of California San Francisco\nand gastroenterology fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr.\nCao’s main research interests are in the mucosal immunity and biomarker\ndiscovery in inflammatory bowel disease. His clinical interests include colon\ncancer screening, gastrointestinal bleeding, dysphagia and gastroesophageal\nreflux disease. He serves as an Associate Editor for _Inflammation_ and is on\nthe Editorial Board of _Inflammatory Bowel Diseases_. He is on external\ncommittees including National Scientific Advisory Committee of the Crohn’s &\nColitis Foundation and Executive Committee of the Southern Society for\nClinical Investigation.\n\n## Research Interests\n\nI am broadly interested in disease-related cellular and molecular pathways in\ninflammation of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel disease\n(IBD, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), IBD-associated tumorigenesis,\nand eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). I am fascinated by the inter-connection of\nthese pathologically distinctive diseases. We strive to uncover the pathogenic\nmechanisms and identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets using molecular and\ncell biology, multi-omics technologies (e.g., single-cell and spatial\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, whole-genome/exome sequencing, metagenomics),\npreclinical models, and human tissues. Our current projects include: 1) Innate\nlymphoid cells (ILCs) in murine IBD; 2) Innate immune mechanisms in perianal\nand stricturing Crohn’s disease; 3) Multi-omics of IBD-related complications;\n4) Biomarker discovery for IBD therapies (e.g., anti-IL-23s); 5) ILCs and\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in IBD-associated colorectal cancer;\n6) ILC2s in murine and human EoE. My laboratory is currently supported by the\nNIH, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation, American Gastroenterological Association,\nAmerican College of Gastroenterology, and Washington University Institute of\nClinical and Translational Sciences.\n\n## Research Publications\n\n#### Selected Publications\n\n  * Yangzhuangzhuang Zhu, **Siyan Cao**.

Dr. Ding's research focuses on integrating cancer\nproteogenomics (including single cell and spatial omics), patient-derived\ncancer models, functional genomics, and drug development to advance cancer\nbiology and precision medicine. This work spans many cancer types, including\nacute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer,\nprostate cancer, glioblastoma, and multiple myeloma, with key findings\nincluding the identification and characterization of pathogenic germline\nvariants and somatic cancer drivers, and discovery of age-related clonal\nhematopoiesis. Her research team has also developed widely-used computational\ntools, including VarScan, SciClone, BreakDancer, MSIsensor, Pindel-C,\nHotSpot3D, and MuSiC and she plays significant roles and co-chairs various\ngroups within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome\nConsortium (ICGC), the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC),\nthe Patient-Derived Xenografts Development and Trial Centers Research Network\n(PDXNet), Patient Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS), Cellular\nSenescence Network (SenNet), and Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). She also\nserves on the Steering Committees of CPTAC, TCGA, PDXnet, PE-CGS, SenNet, and\nco-chairs the HTAN Steering Committee. Dr. Ding has been recognized several\ntimes among Thomson-Reuters’ surveys of influential researchers, including\nlisting among “The World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds”, and was a\nmember of a group honored with the American Association of Cancer Research\nTeam Science Award for contributions to TCGA. Her work continues to be\ninspired by the ultimate goal of making personalized medicine a reality for\ncancer patients.\n\n# Group photos\n\n![January

Neuroscience society, Society for\nNeuroscience, Society for NeuroEconomics, Human brain mapping  \nResearch Outline |  \n  \nEach individual has his/her own natural tempo/speed in walking, speaking and\nother activities. Such tempo preference may reflect individual cognitive\nspeed, personality traits, and/or life styles, and thus determine the\nuniqueness of human behaviors.\n\nAs a researcher with psychology and neuroscience background and long-standing\ninterest in human brain and behaviors, currently, I am particularly interested\nin how human brain generates spontaneous/natural motor tempo, followed by why\npeople show the large individual differences on natural tempo preference, can\nwe predict such individual differences based on task-free and task-based\nneural activities during spontaneous movement activity.\n\nOur neural findings may provide seeds for behavioral/neural intervention via\nneuro-feedback or noninvasive brain stimulation. Our study may lead to\napps/software application and engineering products development to help to\nimprove general physical and mental health among both normal people and\npatients, i.e. tuning natural tempo into daily activities to optimize\nperformance or reduce stress/anxiety levels thus leading a natural life.  \n  \n![](media/images/Researcher/creative/suns/sunsai02.png)\n\nFig.1 Research outline framework\n\n#### Related Posts\n\n  * [![](media/images/Researcher/spacer300x190.png)Topics2023.05.29 Assistant Professor Sai Sun received Tohoku University ECEI Excellent Young Researcher Award (東北大](en/feature/topics/detail---id-1289.html)\n\nPAGE TOP\n\n### Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences\n\n  * ####  About FRIS \n\n    * [Greetings](en/about/greetings.html)\n    * [Overview](en/about/overview.html)\n    * [Missions](en/about/missions/)\n    * [Organization](en/about/organization.html)\n    * [Tenure track system in FRIS](en/about/tenure-track.html)\n    * [Maps & Directions](en/about/access.html)\n    * [Publication](en/about/publication/)\n    * [Annual Meeting](en/about/annualmeeting/)\n    * [Consultation Desk](en/about/consultation.html)\n    * [DEI Promotion](en/about/dei.html)\n  * ####  Researcher \n\n    * [Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Division](en/researcher/advanced/)\n    * [Creative Interdisciplinary Research Division](en/researcher/creative/)\n    * [Managing & Planning Division](en/researcher/managing/)\n    * [Endowed Research Divisions](en/researcher/endowed/)\n    * [Senior-advisor](en/researcher/senior-advisor/)\n    * [Visiting Professors / Collaborative Researchers](en/researcher/visiting-professors/)\n    * [Specially-appointed](en/researcher/specially-appointed/)\n    * [One-time members](en/researcher/creative_onetime/)\n\n####  Feature\n\n    * [Topics](en/feature/topics/)\n    * [FRIS Interviews](en/feature/interviews/)\n    * [FRIS Hub Meeting](en/feature/fris-hubmeeting/)\n  * ####  Research Programs \n\n    * [Open Research Proposal](en/research_programs/invitation/)\n    * [Research Projects](en/research_programs/research-project/)\n\n####  Recruit\n\n    * [Open Staff Positions](en/recruit/invitation/)\n    * [Useful Information for International Researchers](en/recruit/info_intlresearchers/)\n    * [FRIS Undergraduate Research Work Opportunities](en/recruit/fris-uro/)\n  * #### FRIS CoRE\n\n    * [FRIS CoRE](https://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fris_core/en/)\n\n#### FRIS Fund\n\n    * [FRIS Fund for Early-Career Independent Researchers](https://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fund/en/)\n  * #### External Links for Early Career Researcher Support\n\n    * [Division for Interdisciplinary Advanced Research and Education (DIARE)](http://www.iiare.tohoku.ac.jp/en/)\n    * [Ensemble Project for Early Career Researchers](https://web.tohoku.ac.jp/aric/english/)\n    * [Support Program for the Article Processing Charge](https://sites.google.com/tohoku.ac.jp/apc-kakudai/english)\n    * [webmail](https://mail.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/webmail/src/login.php)\n    * [LINK](en/about/link.html)\n    * [![](media/images/common/icon_fu_chan.svg)](http://www.fris.tohoku.ac.jp/fris/katahira_fes/efu-house.html)\n    * [![TOHOKU UNIVERSITY](media/images/common/tohoku_univercity.png)](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/)\n\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/footer_jp02x.png)](https://twitter.com/TohokuUniv_FRIS)\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/footer_en02x.png)](https://twitter.com/FRIS_TohokuUniv)\n  * [![](media/files/_u/key_visual/2263covid2.png)](about/information_of_covid2019/)\n\nCopyrights © Frontier Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences,\nTohoku University All rights reserved.\n\nno cache\n\n|  \n---|---  \n|  \n---|---\n\n",

Her teaching and research interests\ninclude modern Chinese literature, with a particular focus on autobiographical\nwritings and practices from the late Qing and early Republican periods, as\nwell as language pedagogy, heritage cultural learning and content-based\ncurriculum development.\n\nLu began her journey as a language instructor while serving as a teaching\nassistant for language courses during her graduate studies at WashU, where she\ndiscovered her passion for teaching. After graduation, she served as a Chinese\nlanguage lecturer at Princeton University for over five years. She has taught\nChinese language courses at all levels, including both heritage and non-\nheritage tracks, as well as advanced-level content-based courses in modern and\nclassical Chinese literature, classical Chinese philosophy, and modern Chinese\nintellectual history. Additionally, she has taught at the Princeton in Beijing\nprogram and the Middlebury Summer Chinese School.\n\nLu's academic background profoundly influences her approaches to language\nteaching. She is particularly interested in integrating her research on self-\nwriting and storytelling into curriculum development. Lu hopes to facilitate\nstudents in finding their own voices and expressing their individual\nexperiences and thoughts while studying Chinese language.\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [Resources](/resources)\n  * [Events](/events)\n  * [Careers & Outcomes](https://ealc.wustl.edu/careers-outcomes)\n  * [Our People](/faculty-staff)\n  * [Alumni](https://ealc.wustl.edu/alumni)\n  * [Contact](/get-in-touch-ealc)\n\n### Additional information\n\n  * [ Arts & Sciences](https://artsci.washu.edu)\n  * [ Graduate Studies in A&S](https://gradstudies.artsci.wustl.edu)\n\n _Copyright 2025 by:_ Arts & Sciences at Washington  \nUniversity in St. Louis\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/washuartsci)\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WUSTLEALC/)\n  * [Twitter](https://x.com/washuartsci)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@washuartsci)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/washu-arts-sciences/)\n\n_Contact Us:_\n\nEast Asian Languages and Cultures  \n[ealc@wustl.edu](mailto:ealc@wustl.edu)\n\n[Visit the main Washington University in St. Louis\nwebsite](https://washu.edu/)1 Brookings Drive / St. Louis, MO 63130 /\nwashu.edu\n\n",

He graduated from Washington University in\nSt. Louis with a B.A. in Biology before returning to Iowa to obtain his MD and\nPhD degrees. He received his MD and PhD degrees as a part of the NIH Medical\nScientist Training Program at the University of Iowa. His PhD thesis work\nunder the mentorship of Dr. Stanley Perlman investigated the mechanisms of\nvirus-induced central nervous system demyelination. While a graduate student,\nhe was a recipient of a National Research Service Award.\n\nDr. Wu began his post-graduate medical education as an intern in Internal\nMedicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Subsequently, he completed a\nNeurology residency in 2005 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\nDuring his residency he was awarded a Penn Pearls Award in recognition of his\nexcellence in medical student education. He received several awards from the\nNorth American Neuro-Ophthalmology Association for research on visual outcome\nstudies in multiple sclerosis led by Dr. Laura Balcer.\n\nFollowing residency, Dr. Wu trained as a Multiple Sclerosis fellow at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He received a National Multiple Sclerosis Society\npostdoctoral fellowship from 2005-2008, which supported postdoctoral research\ntraining in autoimmunity under the guidance of Dr. Terri Laufer at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. In 2008 he was the recipient of a K08 career\ndevelopment award from the NIH for his work investigating the role of\ndendritic cells in an animal model for MS. That same year he was appointed\ninstructor in the department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n",

Ding,\nMD](https://anesthesiology.wustl.edu/app/uploads/2022/10/Photo-280x386.png)\n\n# Ding Ding, MD\n\nPGY-4 Resident\n\nDing Ding is a current resident physician in the Department of Anesthesiology.\nShe was born and raised in China. In her early years, Dr. Ding demonstrated\ntalents in the field of physics, mathematics, and computer engineering. She\nreceived a bachelor’s degree in modern physics from the University of Science\nand Technology of China and a master’s degree in electrical and computer\nengineering from the University of Colorado Boulder. She then worked at the\nFPGA pioneer Xilinx Inc. as a project lead for a number of years.\n\nAfter realizing her deep desire to become a physician and have a more personal\nrole in helping others, she resigned from this position to enter medical\nschool. She graduated from the University of Colorado School of Medicine in\n2019 with honors and publications in high-impact journals. Dr. Ding has shown\na dedication to maintaining her high professional standard and pursuit of\nexcellence while being a single parent and with additional obligations of\ncaring for her aging parents.\n\nOutside of work, she enjoys time with family, hiking, cooking, performing\narts, and traveling. She will be pursuing a fellowship in regional and acute\npain at WashU after residency.\n\n## WashU Medicine Department of Anesthesiology\n\n[WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/)\n\n660 S.

I am an Instructor in the Department of OBGYN at\nWashington University in St. Louis with expertise in statistical data analysis\nand modeling development. With a broad background in biophysics and\nstatistics, I am interested in developing multi-level modeling and Machine\nLearning/Deep Learning methodologies for clinical studies and medical\nscientific research.  \n  \nMy research focuses on applying different modeling techniques in clinical\nstudies and developing novel computational models related to maternal and\nfetal health, including adverse pregnancy outcomes, preterm birth prediction,\ncervical remodeling, and uterine maturation. I contributed to many projects in\nthe Prematurity Research Center, mainly focused on the March of Dimes 1000\nwomen cohort study to predict preterm birth. I developed a novel computational\nmethod to analyze actigraphy data and published an online application as an\nautomatic analytical tool. I established an innovative methodology for\nquantitatively measuring cervix tissue stiffness from transvaginal ultrasound\nimages. I also developed the statistical analysis methodology for\nElectromyometrial Imaging, a system with which uterine electrical activity can\nbe noninvasively measured and mapped onto the entire uterine surface in three\ndimensions.\n\n#### Poster(s):\n\n  * [(608) Fully quantitative numeric cervical softening device at 37 weeks: Information for labor management decision making?](/ajaxcalls/PosterInfo.asp?PosterID=643886)\n\n__Tuesday, February 13, 2024\n\n__3:30 PM – 5:00 PM\n\n  * [(682) Neighborhood, race, or both?

My work contributed to the recent\nmomentum in understanding the globalization of food in deep antiquity and its\nbiological and social consequences. It has also prompted a reconsideration of\nglobal prehistory with greater appreciation of the presence of the East and\nGlobal South. I have conducted fieldwork on the Tibetan Plateau, in the Hexi\nCorridor, Inner Mongolia, and regions across Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\nIt highlights the relevance of archaeological investigations to contemporary\nchallenges and draws inspirations from humanity at its deepest levels.\n\nMy recent work centers on the domestication of millet—a generic term for\nsmall-grained cereals—that has been historically significant across extensive\nbiogeographies, sustaining ancient populations in the Global South. Today,\nmillet is consumed less frequently in the developed world, thus attracting\nlittle scientific attention compared to their high-yielding, large-grained\ncounterparts. However, given their ecological merit and deep community roots,\nmillets are among the key solutions to achieving food security and\nsustainability.\n\nI serve as a permanent committee member of the International Work Group of\nPaleoethnobotany and am an Associate Editor of journals _Environmental\nArchaeology_ and _Archaeological Research in Asia_. Additionally, I am on the\neditorial boards of _PLOS ONE_ , _Frontiers in Plant Science_ , and _Frontiers\nin Environmental Archaeology_.\n\nMembers of my lab group, the [Laboratory for the Analysis of Early Food-Webs\n(LAEF)](http://sites.wustl.edu/earlyfoodwebs/), utilize a multidisciplinary\napproach to bear upon questions related to nutrition and ecology, paleodiet\nand paleoenvironment. They conduct research in a diverse range of\nenvironments, including the Tibetan Plateau, Lower Yangtze, Kazakhstan, Mayan\nlowland, the Andes and Costa Rica.\n\n**SELECTED PUBLICATIONS (see CV for the full list and**[ **google\nscholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xGtNQ1kAAAAJ&hl=en) **)**\n\nZhang, Z., H.

Her group\nfocuses on epigenetic regulation by exploring how chromatin dynamics is\nestablished, maintained, erased, and inherited over time, and how altered\nchromatin modifications lead to improved plant traits and environmental\nadaptation. They combine functional genomics and high-throughput proteomics\nand genomics techniques together with traditional genetic and biochemical\ntools to understand the function and mechanism of epigenetic processes and\ndevelop novel chromatin-based technology for biomass production and\nagricultural improvement.\n\n### In the news:\n\n[Molecular Puzzles in 3D: Understanding a Mechanism for\nMethylation](https://wid.wisc.edu/molecular-puzzles-in-3d-understanding-a-\nmechanism-for-methylation/)\n\n[Professor Zhong awarded the H.

These systems guard\nagainst external and internal insults on the genome and transcriptome by\nrepairing damaged DNA structures or by eliminating faulty RNA molecules.\nDefects in these systems can alter the functions of the cell and cause many\nhuman diseases. A prominent example is cancer, which is characterized by\ngenomic instability, aberrant gene expression and uncontrolled cell\nproliferation.\n\nOur lab investigates the molecular mechanisms of the **_replication stress\nresponse_** and the **_DNA damage response_**. We are also interested in an\nRNA surveillance pathway called **_nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD)_** and\nits interplay with DNA surveillance mechanisms. We utilize a combination of\ncell biological, biochemical and imaging approaches and techniques to decipher\nkey mechanisms of the DNA/RNA surveillance networks with the goal to improve\nthe understanding and treatment of cancer.\n\n* * *\n\n## News\n\n[Tweets by YouLab_WashU](https://twitter.com/YouLab_WashU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n##  [October 1, 2024](https://youlab.wustl.edu/september-9-2024/)\n\nYutong Geng has joined our lab for her rotation.

One of the major symptoms of migraine, the\nrecurring headache, is highly debilitating, poorly understood and difficult to\ntreat. A significant proportion of patients have headaches that are not\nresponsive to current therapies and increase in frequency over time,\neventually becoming chronic migraine.\n\nResearch in our lab focuses on understanding the mechanisms of episodic and\nchronic migraine from both cellular and systems neuroscience perspectives. We\nemploy a multidisciplinary approach including state-of-the-art technologies in\nelectrophysiology, time-lapse imaging, anatomical tracing, single neuron\nprofiling as well as mouse genetics and behavioral assays. Current research\nprojects include:\n\n1) To understand how migraine-associated ion channel mutations affect channel\nbiophysics, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and ultimately the\nencoding of headache.\n\n2) To study the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the transition\nfrom episodic to chronic migraine in mouse models.\n\n3) To investigate how the innate and adaptive immune systems modulate the\nneuronal circuits underlying migraine headache.\n\nThrough these mechanistic studies, we hope to identify novel molecular and\ncellular targets for the development of new abortive and prophylactic\ntherapeutics for migraine and other primary headache disorders.\n\n[![](https://dbrcaolab.wustl.edu/files/2019/01/research_main-23vmfta.jpeg)](https://dbrcaolab.wustl.edu/files/2019/01/research_main-23vmfta.jpeg)\n\n## Cao Lab\n\n[WashU Medicine Department of\nAnesthesiology](https://anesthesiology.wustl.edu/)\n\n660 S.

Clinical Interests\n\n  * Development of antigen-specific immunotherapy of type 1 diabetes \n  * Identification of biomarkers for indicating the onset of type 1 diabetes \n  * Identification of post-translational modifications that indicate islet dysfunction\n\n## Research Interests\n\nOur laboratory focuses on examining pathogenic events responsible for\ninitiating the development of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases. We\nprimarily employ mouse experimental models to mechanistically dissect key\nfactors involved in type 1 diabetes, a deteriorating autoimmune disorder that\neventually destroys insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets. The\nresearch projects center on 1) Identifying antigenic targets involved in\ndisease pathogenesis, which not only serves as a platform for activating\nantigen-specific autoreactive T cells but also can be used as diagnostic and\ntherapeutic targets; 2) Examining the biological behaviors of the tissue\ninnate immune system that finely tunes tissue homeostasis and shapes the\nphenotypic signatures of localized autoimmunity.\n\nWe recently identified a specific site in pancreatic β cells, the crinosomes,\nresponsible for generating disease-relevant peptides. Crinosomes are a\nspecific set of vesicles formed by fusion of insulin granules with lysosomes.\nAs an enzyme-rich structure, crinosomes not only generate unique or “cryptic”\nepitopes from degraded protein segments but also produce neoepitopes formed by\npost-translational modifications. These immunogenic materials are released\ninto circulation during β-cell degranulation and become an antigen source for\nsensitizing peripheral lymphoid tissues. We aim to better understand crinosome\nbiology and apply this knowledge to diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of type\n1 diabetes. Using a platform integrating mass spectrometry with immunological\ncharacterization, we are moving forward to determine disease-relevant epitopes\nin the islets and peripheral blood from humans with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe pancreatic islet is a mini-organ essential for maintaining body\nmetabolism. This tissue contains several types of endocrine cells, including\nthe insulin-producing β cells, but only consists of one immune cell, the\nresident macrophages. Lineage tracing studies indicate that islet macrophages\nderive from definitive hematopoiesis. The islet macrophages are in intimate\ncontact with β cells, extending long filopodia in between them. Some of these\nfilopodia enter the blood lumen and can capture microparticles. Islet\nmacrophages isolated from different mouse strains (NOD, NOD.Rag1–/–, B6) have\na high expression of genes encoding MHC-II, costimulatory molecules, and\ninflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We consider such an activation state as\na self-defensive mechanism for protecting the islets from pathogen infections.\nHowever, autoimmune risk can also be precipitated to foster incoming\nautoimmune responses. We seek to dissect the key factors expressed by the\nislet macrophages that not only influence β-cell biology during homeostasis\nbut also play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes.\n\n## DBBS Affiliation\n\n  * Immunology Program\n\n## Selected Publications\n\n[**PubMed Search**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Xiaoxiao+Wan)\n\n**Wan, X** , Thomas, JW, Unanue, ER.

Structural insights give us a novel\nangle to elucidate the actions of these proteins in cellular settings.

The division’s emphasis is on high impact projects that are\ncommensurate with our capabilities and resources. Over the years, we have\nprovided the leadership in several significant developments in radiation\ntherapy, and we are consistently recognized as one of the leading medical\nphysics groups in the world.\n\nPhysics faculty are active participants and lead numerous research activities\nin the department. Research includes image acquisition and reconstruction,\nfunctional/biological imaging, advanced treatment planning applications,\nquality assurance, instrumentation, and development of novel procedures and\ntreatment technologies, along with more fundamental physical and mathematical\nscience. Physics faculty collaborate with industry partners to develop\nemerging technology through Master Research and Services Agreements. The\ndivision has pioneered MR-guided therapy with adaptive planning, and has\nbecome a world leader in adaptive radiotherapy. The division also played a key\nrole in the development of modern CT simulation technology. Clinical research\nand collaboration with commercial partners has resulted in several commercial\nproducts that are now used around the world.\n\n![](https://radonc.wustl.edu/files/2016/10/Med-Phys-Core-\nValues_grayPanel_forweb-23r695w.jpg)\n\n## Physics Labs & Links\n\n  * [Arash Darafsheh Lab](https://darafshehlab.wustl.edu)\n  * [Geoffrey Hugo Lab](http://hugolab.wustl.edu)\n  * [Hua Li Lab – Medical Imaging & Bioinformatics Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/huali/)\n  * [The Zhang Translational Genomics Laboratory](https://sites.wustl.edu/jinzhang/)\n  * [Software Tools](https://radonc.wustl.edu/software-tools/)\n  * [Ethos Adaptive Planning Template Download](https://radonc.wustl.edu/ethos-adaptive-planning-templates/)\n\n  * [Research](https://radonc.wustl.edu/research/)\n    * [Cancer Biology Research](https://radonc.wustl.edu/research/cancer-biology-research/)\n    * [Clinical Research](https://radonc.wustl.edu/research/clinical-research/)\n    * [Medical Physics Research](https://radonc.wustl.edu/research/physics-research/)\n\n  * [Instagram](https://instagram.com/@washumedradonc)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/washumedradonc/about/?viewAsMember=true)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@washumedradonc)\n\n**WashU Medicine Department of Radiation Oncology**  \n**Mailing Address:** 660 S.

Research\n\nShare this Story:\n\n![]()\n\n__\n\nA Brown School professor is joining forces with St. Louis community leaders to\nteach the rudiments of Artificial Intelligence to a wide array of local\naudiences with a variety of interests. He discovered just how varied the\nappetite for AI is when a dozen students from the Missouri School for the\nBlind showed up to participate in a session he led at a branch of the St.\nLouis Public Library on creating art with AI.\n\n“They were absolutely amazing,” said the associate professor, [Ruopeng\nAn](https://brownschool.washu.edu/faculty-and-research/ruopeng-an/ \"Ruopeng\nAn\"). “After the lecture, they practiced on the computer. The AI system\ngenerated artwork that was a reflection of themselves.”\n\nThe event, recently released on\n[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1d2LuR0xjc&ab_channel=HECEducation),\nattracted 29 participants from around the St. Louis area, with more sessions\nto come, according to An, as part of the school’s [Open\nClassroom](https://brownschool.washu.edu/resources-initiatives/professional-\ndevelopment/?selected_category=open-classroom \"Open Classroom\"), Artificial\nIntelligence Applications for Health Data Adult Learning Certificate (ALC),\nand the Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics for Public Health\n(AIBDA) certificate program. The idea was sparked by Sarah Sims, assistant\ndirector of [Professional\nDevelopment](https://brownschool.washu.edu/resources-initiatives/professional-\ndevelopment/ \"Professional Development\"), whose husband is on staff at the St.\nLouis Library. An was approached to offer local training, and brought his\nstudents to the library to help.\n\nThe event gave people their first taste of AI. “They had heard of it, but\nnever experienced the power of AI for themselves,” An said. He said creating\nart was a great way to showcase that power, and suitable for students of all\nages – more than half were under 18. The lecture provided guidance on how to\nwrite “prompts” for AI to use. The students generated artworks printed at the\nlibrary and mailed home.\n\nIn addition to the library events, An plans to offer training sessions to non-\nprofit organizations in the St. Louis area through Delmar DivINe. He will\noffer an AI workshop in April at the St. Louis Modern Chinese School for\nstudents and their parents.\n\nMary Meyer, manager of Digital Services for the St. Louis Public Library, said\nthe November program at the Julia Davis branch was “a perfect space” for the\nworkshop. The library offers digital maker spaces that focus on creativity and\nbringing together community resources. “We’ve seen a huge use of these\nresources,” she said. “The AI workshop was really engaging, everyone was\nexcited to create something, and our staff had so much fun seeing what people\nwere creating. We would definitely hope to host another AI event in the\nfuture.”\n\nOne participant was Rachel Tang, a high school senior who’ll be attending\nWashington University in the fall. She plans to major in environmental\nanalysis, but has a side interest in art. “I thought it would be a good\nintroduction to AI,” she said. “It was really interesting to see how you can\nuse words to come up with an art piece. It really opened up a new door for my\nart hobby.”\n\n## You may also enjoy:\n\n  * [![](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/05/newsuganda-680x422.jpg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/postdoctoral-researcher-addresses-intimate-partner-violence-and-hiv-treatment-in-uganda/)\n\n### Postdoctoral researcher addresses intimate partner violence and HIV\ntreatment in Uganda\n\n[Read this story ![Arrow Link\nImage](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/link-\narrow.svg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/postdoctoral-researcher-\naddresses-intimate-partner-violence-and-hiv-treatment-in-uganda/)\n\n  * [![](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/05/1newsanigi-680x422.gif)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/student-speaker-celebrates-resilience-and-hope-at-brown-school-recognition-ceremony/)\n\n### Student speaker celebrates resilience and hope at Brown School Recognition\nCeremony\n\n[Read this story ![Arrow Link\nImage](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/link-\narrow.svg)](https://brownschool.washu.edu/2025/05/student-speaker-celebrates-\nresilience-and-hope-at-brown-school-recognition-ceremony/)\n\n[![WashU Brown School 100\nBanner](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/WashU_Brown_School_100_Banner_RGB-\nfilled.png)](/washu-brown-school-100/ \"Brown School Centennial\")\n\n#### Quick Links:\n\n  * [Apply](https://brownschool.washu.edu/admissions-aid/apply/)\n  * [About Brown School](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://brownschool.washu.edu/contact-us/)\n  * [Directions](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/directions/)\n  * [Academic Professional Integrity Policy](https://brownschool.washu.edu/academics/academic-professional-integrity/)\n  * [Native Land Acknowledgement](https://brownschool.washu.edu/about/native-land-acknowledgement/)\n\n![Washington University\nLogo](https://brownschool.washu.edu/app/themes/brownschool/assets/images/wustl-\nlogo.png)  \n[WashU.edu ](https://washu.edu \"Washington University Website\")\n\nKeep Up with Our Latest  \nNews, Research and Insights:\n\n  * [](https://www.youtube.com/@WashUbrownschool \"youtube\")\n  * [](https://www.tiktok.com/@washubrownschool \"tiktok\")\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/washubrownschool/ \"facebook\")\n  * [](https://www.instagram.com/washubrownschool/ \"instagram\")\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/washubrownschool/ \"linkedin\")\n\nFounded in 1925, the George Warren Brown School was named with a generous gift\nfrom Betty Bofinger Brown in memory of her late husband.  \n  \nCopyright 2025 by WashU Brown School  Washington University • One Brookings\nDrive  \n• St. Louis, MO 63130\n\nNotifications\n\n",

As we gain more knowledge about microglial biology—one\nof the fastest growing fields at the nexus of neuroscience, immunology and\nhematopoiesis, numerous fundamental questions remain to be answered, such as:\nHow is microglia fate specified? How do microglia develop? How heterogeneous\nare microglia? How do microglia age? How do microglia contribute to brain\ndevelopment, aging and disease?\n\nThe Li laboratory is broadly interested in neuroimmunology with a focus on\nmicroglial biology. Particularly, the lab is interested in combining cutting-\nedge single-cell genomic technologies with in vitro and in vivo genetic,\nmolecular and cellular tools to investigate microglial development,\nheterogeneity and mechanisms of neuro-immune interactions underlying brain\nstructure and disease. We try to address two major questions: (1) how\nmicroglia (and other immune cells) are different in development, homeostasis\nand aging, and related to that, how these different populations of microglia\ninteract with other neural cells to control brain development and functioning;\n(2) how microglial fate is specified and diverged from other tissue\nmacrophages during early embryonic development. By studying these questions,\nthe overarching goal is to gain a better understanding of microglial functions\nin the establishment of the nervous system, as well as how changes in these\nfunctions contribute to neurological diseases.\n\n* * *\n\n## Selected publications\n\n  * Barclay KM, Abduljawad N, Cheng Z, Kim MW, Zhou L, Yang J, Rustenhoven J, Mazzitelli JA, Smyth LCD, Kapadia D, Brioschi S, Beatty W, Hou J, Saligrama N, Colonna M, Yu G, Kipnis J, Li Q.

Carbon content in particles is merely < 3%.\n\n![](https://sites.wustl.edu/bailab/files/2024/04/Slide1-4dfff17a8f0365a3-1024x472.jpg)\n\n  * Ideally stable Na metal anode in the correct electrolyte\n\n![](https://sites.wustl.edu/bailab/files/2023/06/Smooth.gif)The actual plating\nprocess was paused twice, one for 8 hours and the other for 16 hours, which,\nhowever, did not affect the ideal smoothness.\n\n  * Spiky Na growths (not dendrite) in the “wrong” electrolyte\n\n![](https://sites.wustl.edu/bailab/files/2023/06/Spiky.gif)The “wrong”\nelectrolyte caused bad SEI that undermined the current distribution at the\nelectrode surface. The spiky structures must not be called dendrites, as they\nwere not induced by transport limitation.\n\nMore details can be found in our [2021 open-access\npaper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202005006).\n\n©2025 Washington University in St. Louis\n\nNotifications\n\n",

Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral\nassociate in the Supertech research group in MIT CSAIL. I received my S.M. and\nPh.D. from MIT, under the supervision of [Prof. Charles E.\nLeiserson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/). I received my Bachelor of\nScience in Computer Science from [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/), where I\nworked on the Simultaneous Multithreading Simulator for DEC Alpha under the\nsupervision of [Prof. Dean Tullsen](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tullsen/).\n\n## Research Interests\n\nMy research agenda is to make parallel programming accessible for everyone, so\nthat every programmer, particularly the non-experts, can rapidly develop high\nperformance software that takes advantage of commodity multicore hardware. To\nthat end, I am interested in many aspects of parallel computing, including\ndesigning programming models and linguistic constructs to simplify parallel\nprogramming, developing runtime and operating system support to enable\nmultithreaded programs to execute efficiently, and building software tools to\naid debugging and performance engineering of multithreaded code.\n\n## Teaching\n\n  * Concepts in Multicore Computing (G)  \nInstructor for Spring 2015, 2018, and 2020, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Current Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/cse539)  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse539/spr18)\n\n  * Introduction to Systems Software (U)  \nInstructor for Fall 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and Spring 2019, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse361/fall19)  \n\n  * Parallel and Sequential Algorithms (U/G)  \nInstructor (co-taught with [Prof. Kunal\nAgrawal](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/)) for Fall 2014, WUSTL CSE  \n[ Past Course Page](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/archive/cse341/fall14)\n\n  * 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems (U)  \nInstructor (co-taught with [ Prof. Charles E.\nLeiserson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/cel/)) for Fall 2012, MIT EECS  \n[ Course Page](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/fa12/6.172/index.html)\n\n## Conference and Journal Publications\n\n  * [ An Efficient Scheduler for Task-Parallel Interactive Applications](papers/ws-interactive.pdf)  \nKyle Singer, Kunal Agrawal, and I-Ting Angelina Lee  \nSPAA '23: Proceedings of the 35th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms\nand Architectures, 2023  \n\n  * [ Responsive Parallelism with Synchronization](papers/responsive.pdf)  \nStefan K.

Specifically, Dr. Gao’s current\nresearch involves (1) the assessment of clinical prediction rules, (2) the\nprediction of survival outcome with time-dependent covariates, (3) growth\nmixture modeling of longitudinal data, and (4) joint modeling of longitudinal\nand survival data. He developed a joint model of longitudinal and survival\ndata to assess whether the fluctuation of intraocular pressure is an\nindependent predictor to the risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma.\nHe also developed a growth mixture model to identify distinct patterns of\nbiomarker trajectories and to monitor disease progression using multivariate\nlongitudinal biomarkers. He is currently providing statistical support for\ncancer-related studies in the Siteman Cancer Center. His responsibilities\ninclude study design, safety monitoring, data analysis, and\nmanuscript/abstract preparation.\n\n[NCBI Bibliography for Dr.\nGao](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/feng.gao.2/bibliography/41145090/public/?sort=date&direction=\ndescending)\n\n[Research Profile](https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/persons/feng-gao)\n\nContact\n\n    \n\nComing soon.\n\n## Mary Culver Department of Surgery\n\n[WashU Medicine](https://medicine.washu.edu/)\n\nMSC 8109-29-2300\n\n4590 Nash Way (formerly Children’s Place)\n\nSuite 2300\n\nSt. Louis, MO 63110\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/WashUSurg)\n  * [Instagram](https://instagram.com/washusurg)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@WashUSurgery)\n\n©2025 Washington University in St. Louis\n\nNotifications\n\n",
